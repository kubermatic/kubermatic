# Scripts list and their description

This file is generated by running `hack/meta.sh`.

## changelog-gen.sh

Create a changelog since last release, commit and create a new release tag

    Usage:
    changelog-gen.sh -r v2.x.x - create changelog, commit and tag new release, using closed PRs release-note

## coverage.sh

Generate test coverage statistics for Go packages.

Works around the fact that `go test -coverprofile` currently does not work  
with multiple packages, see https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6909

    Usage: cover.sh [--html]

    --html      Additionally create HTML report and open it in browser

## gen-api-client.sh

Generates the KKP API Swagger spec and client. The generated client is then
used in the api-e2e tests and published into https://github.com/kubermatic/go-kubermatic

## lib.sh

Contains commonly used functions for the other scripts.

## meta.sh

This README.md generator

That generates README.md with all scripts from this directory described.

## publish-s3-exporter.sh

Releases a new quay.io/kubermatic/s3-exporter Docker image; must be
run manually whenever the s3-exporter is updated.

## release-docker-images.sh

Builds and pushes all KKP Docker images:

* quay.io/kubermatic/kubermatic[-ee]
* quay.io/kubermatic/addons
* quay.io/kubermatic/openshift-addons
* quay.io/kubermatic/nodeport-proxy
* quay.io/kubermatic/kubeletdnat-controller
* quay.io/kubermatic/user-ssh-keys-agent
* quay.io/kubermatic/etcd-launcher

The images are tagged with all arguments given to the script, i.e
`./release-docker-images.sh foo bar` will tag `kubermatic:foo` and
`kubermatic:bar`.

Before running this script, all binaries in `cmd/` must have been
built already by running `make build`.

## retag-images.sh

This script takes YAML on stdin and tries to find all references
to Docker images. The found images will then be pulled, retagged
with `$TARGET_REGISTRY` as their registry and pushed to said target
registry.

The purpose of this is to mirror all images used in a KKP setup
to prewarm a local Docker registry, for example in offline setups.

## run-api.sh

TBD

## run-conformance-tests.sh

Compiles the conformance tests and then runs them in a local Docker
container (by default). This requires KKP and an OIDC provider (like Dex)
to be installed, with a `$KUBECONFIG` pointing to the KKP master cluster.

The tests run against a single provider, specified via the `PROVIDER`
environment variable (default: `aws`). See this script for the
credential variables for each provider.

OIDC credentials need to be provided either by specifying
`KUBERMATIC_OIDC_LOGIN` and `KUBERMATIC_OIDC_PASSWORD` environment
variables or by setting `CREATE_OIDC_TOKEN=false` and setting
a predefined `KUBEMATIC_OIDC_TOKEN` variable.

Run this script with `-help` to see a list of all available flags on
the conformance tests. Many of these are set by this script, but you
can add and override as you like. NB: If test tests run inside a
container, make sure paths and environment variables can be properly
resolved.

To disable the Docker container, set the variable `NO_DOCKER=true`.
In this mode, you need to have the kube-test binaries and all other
dependencies installed locally on your machine, but it makes testing
against a local KKP setup much easier.

## run-dashboard-and-api.sh

TBD

## run-machine-controller.sh

TBD

## run-master-controller-manager.sh

TBD

## run-nodeport-proxy-e2e-test-in-kind.sh

This script sets up a local KKP installation in kind, deploys a
couple of test Presets and Users and then runs the e2e tests for the
nodeport-proxy.

## run-operator.sh

## update-kubermatic-ca-bundle.sh

## update-kubermatic-chart.sh

TBD

## update-openshift-version-codegen.sh

This script can be used to update the generated image names for Openshift.  
The desired versions msut be configured first in  
codegen/openshift_versions/main.go and a const for each version must be  
added to pkg/controller/openshift/resources/const.go

Also, executing this script requires access to the ocp quay repo.
