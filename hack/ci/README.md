# Scripts list and their description

This file is generated by running `hack/meta.sh`.

## canary-github-release.sh

This script is run for every commit to master and will create
a dummy release in a dedicated GitHub repo. The purpose is to

* test that releasing code actually works, and
* to provide test builds for internal purposes.

## deploy-ci-kubermatic-io.sh

This script is used as a postsubmit job and updates the CI cluster
after every commit to master.

## deploy-dev-asia.sh

This script is used as a postsubmit job and updates the dev-asia seed
cluster after every commit to master.

## deploy-dev.sh

This script is used as a postsubmit job and updates the dev master
cluster after every commit to master.

## deploy-offline.sh

This script is used as a postsubmit job and updates the offline
test cluster.

## deploy-run-2-lab-alpha.sh

TBD

## deploy-run-lab-stable.sh

TBD

## deploy-run.sh

TBD

## deploy.sh

This script is used by all other `deploy-*` scripts to handle the
common deployment logic. It can setup the main, monitoring and logging
stacks by updating the Helm charts on the target cluster.

## download-gocache.sh

This script is used when building Go binaries to download a prewarmed
cache for `$GOCACHE`. This is an uncompressed tar archive in a local
S3-compatible storage, which is just downloaded and extracted. This
significantly speeds up CI jobs, as much fewer packages have to be
compiled.

A dedicated postsubmit job that runs after every change to the master
branch is keeping the cache up-to-date.

## github-release.sh

This script is run for every tagged revision and will create
the appropriate GitHub release and upload source archives. It can be
tweaked by setting a number of environment variables, most importantly:

* `DRY_RUN=false` - set to `true` to not actually talk to GitHub
* `GITHUB_TOKEN` - the OAuth token to use

Whenever this is changed, run the optional `pre-kubermatic-simulate-github-release`
job to (mostly) ensure that the changes will work.

## push-images.sh

This script compiles the KKP binaries and then builds and pushes all
Docker images by using `hack/release-docker-images.sh`. It is only
useful as part of another script to setup KKP for testing.

## run-api-e2e.sh

This script sets up a local KKP installation in kind, deploys a
couple of test Presets and Users and then runs the e2e tests for the
API.

## run-conformance-tester.sh

After having set up a local KKP installation, this script is then
used to run the conformance-tester for a given cloud provider.

## run-e2e-tests.sh

This script sets up a local KKP installation in kind and then
runs the conformance-tester to create userclusters and check their
Kubernetes conformance.

## run-lint.sh

Runs golangci-lint to validate that no issues have been introduced
into the codebase.

## run-offline-test.sh

This script was used to run KKP conformance tests inside an offline
environment.

TODO: This needs to be cleaned up greatly and adjusted to the KKP
Operator. The presubmit job for this script is currently not used.

## setup-kubermatic-in-kind.sh

This script creates a local kind cluster, compiles the KKP binaries,
creates all Docker images and loads them into the kind cluster,
then installs KKP using the KKP installer + operator and sets up a
single shared master/seed system.
This serves as the precursor for all other tests.

This script should be sourced, not called, so callers get the variables
it sets.

## setup-legacy-kubermatic-in-kind.sh

This script creates a local kind cluster, compiles the KKP binaries,
creates all Docker images and loads them into the kind cluster,
then installs KKP using the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart and sets up a
single shared master/seed system.
This serves as the precursor for all other tests.

This script should be sourced, not called, so callers get the variables
it sets.

## sync-apiclient.sh

This script is run as a postsubmit to copy the generated API client
into the github.com/kubermatic/go-kubermatic repository.

## sync-charts.sh

TBD

## test-github-release.sh

This script is used for an optional presubmit to test changes to
the GitHub release logic before they are merged. The script will
perform all steps for a release *except* actually communicating
with GitHub.

## update-docs.sh

Updates the docs repository by copying over a couple of generated
files, like CRD examples and the Prometheus runbook.

## upload-gocache.sh

Runs as a postsubmit and refreshes the gocache by downloading the
previous version, compiling everything and then tar'ing up the
Go cache again.

## verify-chart-versions.sh

This script is used as a presubmit to check that Helm chart versions
have been updated if charts have been modified. Without the Prow env
vars, this script won't run properly.

## verify-user-cluster-prometheus-configs.sh

This ensures that the Prometheus rules deployed into userclusters
are valid Prometheus rules.
