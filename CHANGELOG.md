# Kubermatic 2.20

## [v2.20.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.20.0)

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.20/tutorials_howtos/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure usercluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters.

### Highlights

- Migrate API group `kubermatic.k8s.io` to `kubermatic.k8c.io` ([#8783](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8783)). This change requires a migration of all KKP master/seed clusters. Please consult the [upgrade documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.20/tutorials_howtos/upgrading/upgrade_from_2.19_to_2.20/) for more information.
- Full Nutanix support([#8428](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8428))

# Kubermatic 2.19

## [v2.19.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.2)

### Breaking Changes

- ACTION REQUIRED: Restore correct labels on nodeport-proxy-envoy Deployment. Deleting the existing Deployment for each cluster with the `LoadBalancer` expose strategy if upgrading from affected versions (v2.19.1 or v2.18.6) is necessary ([#9060](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9060))

### Bugfixes

- Fix applying resource requirements when using incomplete overrides (e.g. specifying only limits, but no request for a container) ([#9045](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9045))

## [v2.19.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.1)

### Bugfixes

- ICMP rules migration only runs on Azure NSGs created by KKP ([#8843](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8843))
- Fix apiserver network policy: allow all egress DNS traffic from the apiserver ([#8788](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8788))

### Misc

- Add endpoints to v2 KKP API to query Nutanix clusters, projects and subnets ([#8736](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8736))
- Do not reference Nutanix cluster in KKP API endpoint path for subnets ([#8906](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8906))
- Support custom pod resources for NodePort-Proxy pod for the user cluster ([#9018](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9018))

### Known Issues

- Upgrading to this version is not recommended if the [`LoadBalancer` expose strategy](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.19/tutorials_howtos/networking/expose_strategies/) is used due to a bug in the `nodeport-proxy-envoy` Deployment template (#9059).
- Defining a component override that only gives partial resource configuration (only limits or requests) triggers an exception in the `seed-controller-manager`. If resources are defined in a component override, always define a full set of resource limits and requests to prevent this.

## [v2.19.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.0)

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.19/upgrading/guidelines/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure usercluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters.

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Kubernetes (CVE-2021-44716, CVE-2021-44717, CVE-2021-3711, CVE-2021-3712, CVE-2021-33910) which have been fixed in Kubernetes 1.20.13, 1.21.8, 1.22.5.
Because of these updates, this KKP release includes automatic update rules for all 1.20/1.21/1.22 clusters older than these patch releases. This release also removes all affected Kubernetes versions from the list of supported versions. Once the automated controlplane updates have completed, an administrator must manually patch all vulnerable `MachineDeployment`s in all affected userclusters.

To lower the resource consumption on the seed clusters during the reconciliation / node rotation, it's recommended to adjust the `spec.seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` option in the `KubermaticConfiguration` to restrict the number of parallel updates.

The automatic update rules can, if needed, be overwritten using the `spec.versions.kubernetes.updates` field in the `KubermaticConfiguration`. See [#7825](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7824) for how the versions and updates are configured. It is however not recommended to deviate from the default and leave userclusters vulnerable.

### Highlights

- **All Your Clusters Under One Roof With External Cluster Support:** Import your existing AKS, EKS and GKE clusters and manage their entire lifecycle including upgrades and replica counts from our intuitive UI.
- **More Control Over Your Hybrid and Edge Deployments With OSM Support (Experimental):** KKP 2.19 adds experimental support for the [Operating System Manager](https://github.com/kubermatic/operating-system-manager) (OSM) to extend the functionality of the [Kubermatic Machine-Controller](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller). This gives you better control over your OS in hybrid cloud and edge environments.
- **Best-in-Class Networking with Cilium Support:** With Cilium CNI support, KKP users can now choose between the two most popular CNIs Canal and Cilium or simply add and manage a CNI of their choice; regardless of whether it’s supported by KKP or not.
- **Enhanced Control Plane Networking with Konnectivity Support:** To harness the power of Cilium with eBPF, KKP 2.19 comes with added Konnectivity support. It provides TCP level proxy for the control plane (seed cluster) to worker nodes (user cluster) communication. It is based on the upstream [apiserver-network-proxy project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-network-proxy) and replaces the older KKP-specific solution based on OpenVPN and network address translation.
- **Multiple Backup Locations for Improved Business Continuity:** As KKP Admin, you can now configure multiple backup destinations from the UI Admin Panel. Users can select daily, weekly, monthly or customized backup options.

### Breaking Changes

- ACTION REQUIRED: When upgrading from older KKP versions (before v2.19.0), additional flags:
  - `--migrate-upstream-nginx-ingress` is required to perform upgrade of nginx-ingress-controller. Ingress will be briefly unavailable during this process ([#8333](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8333))
  - `--migrate-upstream-cert-manager` is required to perform the migration of the `cert-manager`. During the upgrade, the chart is uninstalled completely so there is a short time when certificates will not be renewed.([#8392](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8392))
- ACTION REQUIRED: Set the default Service Accounts `automountServiceAccountToken` property to false for all KKP provided namespaces and kube-system ([#8344](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8344))
- cert-manager chart has been updated to use upstream chart from https://charts.jetstack.io as a dependency, updated to version 1.6.1
  - ACTION REQUIRED: configuration for cert-manager should now be included under key `cert-manager` in values.yaml file (changed from `certManager`)
  - ACTION REQUIRED: The chart will no longer configure ClusterIssuers. Refer to the documentation of cert-manager for configuration guide: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ ([#8392](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8392))
- The old Docker repository at `quay.io/kubermatic/api` will not receive new images anymore, please use `quay.io/kubermatic/kubermatic` (CE) or `quay.io/kubermatic/kubermatic-ee` (EE) instead. This should only affect EE users who were still using the deprecated Helm chart ([#7922](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7922))
- BREAKING: `-dynamic-datacenters` was effectively already always true when using the KKP Operator and has now been removed as a flag. Support for handling a `datacenters.yaml` has been removed ([#7779](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7779))

#### Dashboard:

- Add multiple backup destinations.
  ACTION REQUIRED: KKP version 2.19 makes it possible to configure multiple destinations, therefore the current implementation of "backup buckets" will be deprecated soon. Migrate the configuration to a destination to keep using it in the future. It is reachable via the UI Admin Panel -> Backup Destinations ([#3911](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/issues/3911))

### Misc

- Fix applying resource requirements when using incomplete overrides (e.g. specifying only limits, but no request for a container) ([#9045](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9045))

## [v2.18.6](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.18.6)

### Bugfixes

### Misc

- Support custom pod resources for NodePort-Proxy pod for the user cluster ([#9028](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9028))

### Known Issues

- Upgrading to this version is not recommended if the [`LoadBalancer` expose strategy](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.18/guides/kkp_networking/expose_strategies/) is used due to a bug in the `nodeport-proxy-envoy` Deployment template (#9059).
- Defining a component override that only gives partial resource configuration (only limits or requests) triggers an exception in the `seed-controller-manager`. If resources are defined in a component override, always define a full set of resource limits and requests to prevent this.

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.18/upgrading/guidelines/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure usercluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhausting on seed clusters.

Two vulnerabilities were identified in Kubernetes ([CVE-2021-25741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) and [CVE-2020-8561](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720)) of which one (CVE-2021-25741) was fixed in Kubernetes 1.19.15 / 1.20.11 / 1.21.5 / 1.22.2. CVE-2020-8561 is mitigated by Kubermatic not allowing users to reconfigure the kube-apiserver.

Because of these updates, this KKP release includes automatic update rules for all 1.19/1.20/1.21/1.22 clusters older than these patch releases. This release also removes all affected Kubernetes versions from the list of supported versions. While CVE-2020-8561 affects the controlplane, CVE-2021-25741 affects the kubelets, which means that updating the controlplane is not enough. Once the automated controlplane updates have completed, an administrator must manually patch all vulnerable `MachineDeployment`s in all affected userclusters.

To lower the resource consumption on the seed clusters during the reconciliation / node rotation, it's recommended to adjust the `spec.seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` option in the `KubermaticConfiguration` to restrict the number of parallel updates.

The automatic update rules can, if needed, be overwritten using the `spec.versions.kubernetes.updates` field in the `KubermaticConfiguration`. See [#7825](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7824) for how the versions and updates are configured. It is however not recommended to deviate from the default and leave userclusters vulnerable.

### Highlights

* User Cluster Monitoring, Logging and Alerting
* Cluster Templates for Deploying Optimal Clusters Instantly
* Metering Tool Integration for Easier Accountability of Resources
* AWS Spot Instances Support to Optimize Workload
* User Cluster Backup & Restore UI
* Enhancements on Open Policy Agent for Allowed Container Registries and Standard Policies

### Breaking Changes

- Kubernetes 1.19 is now the minimum supported version for master, seed and user clusters. Please upgrade all userclusters to 1.19
  prior to upgrading to KKP 2.18. See the [documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.17/tutorials_howtos/upgrading/upgrade_from_2.16_to_2.17/chart_migration/)
  for more details.
- Helm 2 is not supported anymore, please use Helm 3 instead. It might still be possible to install KKP using Helm 2, but it's neither
  supported nor recommended.
- The (in 2.14) deprecated `kubermatic` and `nodeport-proxy` Helm charts have now been removed. If you haven't done so, migrate your KKP installation
  to use the `kubermatic-operator` Helm chart or, even better, use the KKP installer. The KKP operator will automatically manage the
  nodeport-proxy, so the chart is not required anymore.
- The `cert-manager` Helm chart requires admins to set the Let's Encrypt account email explicitly ([#7184](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7184))
- The experimental new backup mechanism was updated and available as an opt-in option per Seed. If enabled, it will replace the old backups and is not backwards compatible. Users that are already using the experimental backup mechanism, be aware that to prepare it for regular use, we made some changes, admins please check the [documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/cheat_sheets/etcd/backup-and-restore/).

# Kubermatic 2.17

## [v2.17.5](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.17.5)

### Bugfixes

- Fix a bug where `$$` in the environment-variables for machine-controller was interpreted in the Kubernetes Manifest and caused machine-controller to be unable to deploy resources, when for e.g. the password contains two consecutive `$` signs ([#7984](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7984))
- Fix for Seed API PATCH endpoint which sometimes removed Seed fields unrelated to the PATCH. Fixes the issue where Seed API was using seed clients to update the Seeds on master cluster instead of using the master client. This was causing Seed API not to work on Seeds which were not also the master clusters ([#7925](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7925))
- Fix setting of nodeport-proxy resource requests/limits, relax default nodeport-proxy envoy limits ([#8169](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8169))




## [v2.17.4](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.17.4)

### Security

Two vulnerabilities were identified in Kubernetes ([CVE-2021-25741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) and [CVE-2020-8561](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720)) of which one (CVE-2021-25741) was fixed in Kubernetes 1.19.15 / 1.20.11 / 1.21.5. CVE-2020-8561 is mitigated by Kubermatic not allowing users to reconfigure the kube-apiserver.

Because of these updates, this KKP release includes automatic update rules for all 1.19/1.20/1.21 clusters older than these patch releases. This release also removes all affected Kubernetes versions from the list of supported versions. While CVE-2020-8561 affects the controlplane, CVE-2021-25741 affects the kubelets, which means that updating the controlplane is not enough. Once the automated controlplane updates have completed, an administrator must manually patch all vulnerable `MachineDeployment`s in all affected userclusters.

To lower the resource consumption on the seed clusters during the reconciliation / node rotation, it's recommended to adjust the `spec.seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` option in the `KubermaticConfiguration` to restrict the number of parallel updates. Users of the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart need to update `kubermatic.maxParallelReconcile` in their `values.yaml` to achieve the same effect.

The automatic update rules can, if needed, be overwritten using the `spec.versions.kubernetes.updates` field in the `KubermaticConfiguration` or updating the `updates.yaml` if using the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart. See [#7825](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7824) for how the versions and updates are configured. It is however not recommended to deviate from the default and leave userclusters vulnerable.

### Misc

- Add support of Kubernetes 1.20 and 1.21 in cluster-autoscaler addon ([#7511](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7511))
- Remove Gatekeeper from the default accessible addon list ([#7533](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7533))
- Fix dashboard source in the Prometheus Exporter dashboard ([#7640](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7640))




## [v2.17.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.17.3)

### Bugfixes

- Prometheus and Promtail resources are not mistakenly deleted from userclusters anymore ([#6881](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6881))
- Paused userclusters do not reconcile in-cluster resources via the usercluster-controller-manager anymore ([#7470](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7470))

### Misc

- Redesign Openstack provider settings step to better support different types of credentials ([#3531](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/issues/3531))
- Changes to the tolerations on the node-local-dns DaemonSet will now be kept instead of being overwritten ([#7466](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7466))




## [v2.17.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.17.2)

### Bugfixes

- Kubermatic API, etcd-launcher, and dnat-controller images are defaulted to the docker.io registry only if the provided custom image has less than 3 parts ([#7287](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7287))
- Fix a bug that always applies default values to container resources ([#7302](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7302))
- Add `ClusterFeatureCCMClusterName` feature for OpenStack clusters. This feature adds the `--cluster-name` flag to the OpenStack external CCM deployment. The feature gate is enabled by default for newly created clusters. Enabling this feature gate for existing clusters will cause the external CCM to lose the track of the existing cloud resources (such as Load Balancers), so it's up to the users to manually clean up any leftover resources ([#7330](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7330))
- Explicitly set the namespace for Dex pods in the oauth chart. This fixes the problem with KKP installation failing on Kubernetes 1.21 clusters ([#7348](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7348))

### Misc

# Kubermatic 2.16

## [v2.16.12](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.16.12)

### Security

Two vulnerabilities were identified in Kubernetes ([CVE-2021-25741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) and [CVE-2020-8561](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720)), of which one (CVE-2021-25741) was fixed in Kubernetes 1.19.15 / 1.20.11. CVE-2020-8561 is mitigated by Kubermatic not allowing users to reconfigure the kube-apiserver.

Because of these updates, this KKP release includes automatic update rules for all 1.19/1.20 clusters older than 1.19.15 / 1.20.11. This release also removes all affected Kubernetes versions from the list of supported versions. While CVE-2020-8561 affects the controlplane, CVE-2021-25741 affects the kubelets, which means that updating the controlplane is not enough. Once the automated controlplane updates have completed, an administrator must manually patch all vulnerable `MachineDeployment`s in all affected userclusters.

To lower the resource consumption on the seed clusters during the reconciliation / node rotation, it's recommended to adjust the `spec.seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` option in the `KubermaticConfiguration` to restrict the number of parallel updates. Users of the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart need to update `kubermatic.maxParallelReconcile` in their `values.yaml` to achieve the same effect.

The automatic update rules can, if needed, be overwritten using the `spec.versions.kubernetes.updates` field in the `KubermaticConfiguration` or updating the `updates.yaml` if using the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart. See [#7824](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7824) for how the versions and updates are configured. It is however not recommended to deviate from the default and leave userclusters vulnerable.

### Misc

- Add support of Kubernetes 1.20 in cluster-autoscaler addon ([#7521](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7521))
- Remove Gatekeeper from default accessible addon list ([#7532](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7532))

### Bugfixes

- Fix a bug that always applies default values to container resources ([#7302](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7302))
- Add `ClusterFeatureCCMClusterName` feature for OpenStack clusters. This feature adds the `--cluster-name` flag to the OpenStack external CCM deployment. The feature gate is enabled by default for newly created clusters. Enabling this feature gate for existing clusters will cause the external CCM to lose the track of the existing cloud resources (such as Load Balancers), so it's up to the users to manually clean up any leftover resources. ([#7330](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7330))

### Misc

- Add support for `use-octavia` setting in Openstack provider specs. It defaults to `true` but leaves the possibility to set it to `false` if your provider doesn't support Octavia yet but Neutron LBaaSv2 ([#6529](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6529))

* 1.18.14
* 1.19.0
* 1.19.2
* 1.19.3

### Highlights

- Add Kubernetes 1.20, remove Kubernetes 1.16 ([#6032](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6032), [#6122](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6122))
- Add Tunneling expose strategy (tech preview) ([#6445](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6445))
- First parts of the revamped V2 API are available as a preview (see API section below)
- cert-manager is not a hard dependency for KKP anymore; certificates are acquired using Ingress annotations instead ([#5962](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/5962), [#5969](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/5969), [#6069](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6069), [#6282](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6282), [#6119](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6119))

### Breaking Changes

- This is the last release for which the legacy Helm chart is available. Users are encouraged to migrate to the KKP Operator.

### Cloud Provider

- Add Anexia provider ([#6101](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6101), [#6128](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6128))

- Default to the latest available OpenStack CCM version. This fixes a bug where newly-created OpenStack clusters running Kubernetes 1.19 were using the in-tree cloud provider instead of the external CCM. Those clusters will remain to use the in-tree cloud provider until the CCM migration mechanism is not implemented. The OpenStack clusters running Kubernetes 1.19+ and created with KKP 2.15.6+ will use the external CCM ([#6272](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6272))
- Use CoreOS-Cloud-Config for Flatcar machines on AWS ([#6405](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6405))

# Kubermatic 2.15

## [v2.15.13](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.15.13)

This is the last planned release for the `release/v2.15` branch. Uses are encouraged to update at least to 2.16 to receive future updates.

### Security

Two vulnerabilities were identified in Kubernetes ([CVE-2021-25741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) and [CVE-2020-8561](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720)) of which one (CVE-2021-25741) was fixed in Kubernetes 1.19.15. CVE-2020-8561 is mitigated by Kubermatic not allowing users to reconfigure the kube-apiserver.

Because of these updates, this KKP release includes an automatic update rule for all 1.19 clusters older than 1.19.15. This release also removes all affected Kubernetes versions from the list of supported versions. While CVE-2020-8561 affects the controlplane, CVE-2021-25741 affects the kubelets, which means that updating the controlplane is not enough. Once the automated controlplane updates have completed, an administrator must manually patch all vulnerable `MachineDeployment`s in all affected userclusters.

To lower the resource consumption on the seed clusters during the reconciliation / node rotation, it's recommended to adjust the `spec.seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` option in the `KubermaticConfiguration` to restrict the number of parallel updates. Users of the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart need to update `kubermatic.maxParallelReconcile` in their `values.yaml` to achieve the same effect.

The automatic update rules can, if needed, be overwritten using the `spec.versions.kubernetes.updates` field in the `KubermaticConfiguration` or updating the `updates.yaml` if using the legacy `kubermatic` Helm chart. See [#7823](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7823) for how the versions and updates are configured. It is however not recommended to deviate from the default and leave userclusters vulnerable.

### Misc

- Upgrade machine-controller to v1.19.2 ([#7164](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7164))
- Fix dashboard source in the Prometheus Exporter dashboard ([#7640](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7640))




## [v2.15.12](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.15.12)

### Misc

- Adds `FELIX_IGNORELOOSERPF=true` to `calico-node` container env to allow running on nodes with `net.ipv4.conf.*.rp_filter = 2` set. [#6864](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6864) ([moelsayed](https://github.com/moelsayed))
- Update machine-controller to 1.19.1. Fixed double instance creation in us-east1 AWS [#6969](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6969) ([kron4eg](https://github.com/kron4eg))

### UI

- Rename every occurrence of "Node Deployment" in the UI to "Machine Deployment" [#3282](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/issues/3282) ([cedi](https://github.com/cedi))




## [v2.15.11](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.15.11)

- Node-local-dns is now using UDP for external queries ([#6796](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6796))




## [v2.15.10](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.15.10)

### Bugfixes

- Fix cert-manager validating webhook ([#6741](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6741))

### Bugfixes

- Fix CA certificates not being mounted on Seed clusters using CentOS/Fedora ([#6680](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6680))




## [v2.15.8](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.15.8)

### Misc

## [v2.15.7](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.15.7)

### Misc

- [ATTN] Fix orphaned apiserver-is-running initContainers in usercluster controlplane. This can cause a short reconciliation burst to bring older usercluster resources in all Seed clusters up to date. Tune the maxReconcileLimit if needed ([#6336](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6336))
- Dex does not require cert-manager CRDs to be installed anymore, certificates are acquired via Ingress annotation ([#6284](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6284))
- Add option to specify Pod Node Selector Configuration ([#2957](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/issues/2957))
- Extend Cluster CRD for PodNodeSelectorAdmissionPluginConfig ([#6402](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6402))
- Add admission control configuration for the user cluster API deployment ([#6431](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6431))
- Default to the latest available OpenStack CCM version. This fixes a bug where newly-created OpenStack clusters running Kubernetes 1.19 were using the in-tree cloud provider instead of the external CCM. Those clusters will remain to use the in-tree cloud provider until the CCM migration mechanism is not implemented. The OpenStack clusters running Kubernetes 1.19+ and created with KKP 2.15.6+ will use the external CCM ([#6300](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6300))
