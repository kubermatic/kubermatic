- Fix missing logo in Dex login screens ([#6019](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6019))
- Fix orphaned apiserver-is-running initContainers in usercluster controlplane. This can cause a short reconciliation burst to bring older usercluster resources in all Seed clusters up to date. Tune the maxReconcileLimit if needed ([#6329](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/6329))
