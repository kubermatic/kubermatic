## [v2.24.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.24.2)

### Action Required

- **ACTION REQUIRED:** User Cluster MLA `cortex` chart has been upgraded to resolve issues for cortex-compactor and improve stability of the User Cluster MLA feature. Few actions are required to be taken to use new upgraded charts ([#12935](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12935))
    - Refer to [Upstream helm chart values](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex-helm-chart/blob/v2.1.0/values.yaml) to see the latest default values
    - Some of the values from earlier `values.yaml` are now incompatible with latest version. They are removed in the `values.yaml` in the current chart. But if you had copied the original values.yaml to customize it further, you may see that `kubermatic-installer` will detect such incompatible options and churn out errors and explain that action that needs to be taken.
    - The memcached-* charts are now subcharts of cortex chart so if you provided configuration for `memcached-*` blocks in your `values.yaml` for user-mla, you must move them under `cortex:` block

### Updates

- Add support for Kubernetes v1.26.13, v1.27.10, v1.28.6 and set default version to v1.27.10 ([#12982](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12982))

### Bugfixes

- If the seed cluster is using Cilium as CNI, create CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy for api-server connectivity ([#12966](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12966))
- Stop constantly re-deploying operating-system-manager when registry mirrors are configured ([#12972](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12972))
- The Kubermatic installer will now detect DNS settings based on the Ingress instead of the nginx-ingress LoadBalancer, allowing for other ingress solutions to be properly detected ([#12934](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12934))

### Removals

- Remove 1.25 from list of supported versions on AKS (EOL on January 14th) ([#12962](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12962))

## [v2.24.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.24.1)

### Bugfixes

- Applied a fix to VPA caused by [upstream release issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/5982) which caused insufficient RBAC permission for VPA recommender pod ([#12872](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12872))
- Fix cert-manager values block. cert-manager deployment will get updated as part of upgrade ([#12854](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12854))
- Fix `mirror-images` command in installer not being able to extract the addons ([#12868](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12868))
- Fix cases where, when using dedicated infra- and ccm-credentials, infra-credentials were always overwritten by ccm-credentials ([#12421](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12421))
- No longer fail constructing vSphere endpoint when a `/` suffix is present in the datacenter configuration ([#12861](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12861))

### New Features

- Openstack: allow configuring Cinder CSI topology support either on `Cluster` or `Seed` resource field `cinderTopologyEnabled` ([#12878](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12878))

### Updates

- Update machine-controller to [v1.58.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/releases/tag/v1.58.1) ([#12902](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12902))
- Update Anexia CCM (cloud-controller-manager) to version 1.5.5 ([#12911](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12911))
    - Fixes leaking LoadBalancer reconciliation metric
    - Updates various dependencies

### Miscellaneous

- KKP is now built with Go 1.21.5 ([#12898](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12898))
- Increase the default resources for VPA components to prevent OOMs ([#12887](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12887))

## [v2.24.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.24.0)

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.24/installation/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure user cluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters. A [full upgrade guide is available from the official documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.24/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.23-to-2.24/).

### Read Before Upgrading

- **ACTION REQUIRED:** legacy backup controller has been removed. Before upgrading, please change to the backup and restore feature that uses [backup destinations](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.24/tutorials-howtos/etcd-backups/) if the legacy controller is still in use ([#12473](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12473))
- `s3-storeuploader` has been removed ([#12473](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12473))
- OpenVPN for control plane to node connectivity has been deprecated. It will be removed in future releases of KKP. Upgrading all user cluster to Konnectivity is strongly recommended ([#12691](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12691))
- User clusters require upgrading to Kubernetes 1.26 prior to upgrading to KKP 2.24 ([#12740](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12740))

### Action Required

- **ACTION REQUIRED (EE ONLY):** Update metering component to v1.1.1, fixing highly inaccurate data in cluster reports. Reports generated in KKP v2.23.2+ or v2.22.5+ do not represent actual consumption. Ad-hoc reports for time frames that need correct consumption data can be generated [by following our documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.24/tutorials-howtos/metering/#custom-reports) ([#12822](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12822))

### API Changes

- The field `vmNetName` in `Cluster` and `Preset` resources for vSphere clusters is deprecated and `networks` should be used instead ([#12444](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12444))
- The field `konnectivityEnabled` in `Cluster` resources is deprecated. Clusters should set this to `true` to migrate off OpenVPN as Konnectivity being enabled will be assumed in future KKP releases ([#12691](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12691))
- Set Cilium as default CNI for user clusters ([#12752](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12752))

### Supported Kubernetes Versions
