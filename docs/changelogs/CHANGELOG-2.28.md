## v2.28.0

**GitHub release: [v2.28.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.28.0)**

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.28/installation/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure user cluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters. A [full upgrade guide is available from the official documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.28/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.27-to-2.28/).

### Breaking Changes

- The deprecated OAuth helm chart has been removed. Before proceeding with KKP upgrade, please follow the [dex migration procedure](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.27/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.26-to-2.27/#dex-v242) to migrate from oauth/dex to the new upstream Dex chart ([#14657](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14657))
- `deploy-default-app-catalog` option from kubermatic-installer has been deprecated and would have no affect going forward. The field `.Spec.Applications.DefaultApplicationCatalog` can be used instead to manage default application catalog ([#14697](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14697))
- Support for multiple security groups has been dropped for OpenStack. If you are using multiple security groups for an OpenStack cluster, you need to manually adjust the `cluster.Spec.Cloud.Openstack.SecurityGroups` ([#14269](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14269))
- Node-exporter chart is now using the upstream helm chart. This means there are some adjustment required to the `values.yaml`. replace the `nodeExporter` with `node-exporter` ([#14176](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14176)) ([#14670](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14670))
- Alertmanager chart was replaced with upstream chart. This means, some of the old values might need migration. Please review documentation ([#14175](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14175))  ([#14675](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14675))
- Blackbox-exporter chart is now using the upstream helm chart indirectly. So the customizations for blackbox-exporter via helm values.yaml should be moved under key `blackbox-exporter` instead of `blackboxExporter` ([#14170](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14170))  ([#14675](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14675))
- Kube-state-metrics chart is now using the upstream helm chart with app version 2.15.0 ([#14174](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14174)) ([#14357](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14357)) ([#14675](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14675))
- New roles for the Kubevirt csi driver have been added and users must add these role to KubeVirt infra cluster kubeconfig service account ([#14502]( https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14502))

### ACTION REQUIRED

- Update cert-manager to v1.16.5. So the following updates should be done values.yaml ([#14400](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14400)): 
    - update `webhook.replicas` to `webhook.replicaCount` 
    - update `cainjector.replicas` to `webhook.replicaCount` 
    - remove `webhook.injectAPIServerCA` 

### API Changes

- The KKP APIs have been moved into a Go module named `k8c.io/kubermatic/v2/sdk` ([#14171](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14171))

### Supported Kubernetes Versions

- Support KubeVirt Subnet CIDR in the Seed object ([#14604](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14604))
- The field `enabledDedicatedCPUs` in KubeVirt provider spec is now deprecated. A new field called `useDomainCPU` is introduced which is for the same purpose. When set to `true` CPU will be assigned by `spec.domain.cpu` for a KubeVirt virtual machine instead of using resource requests and limits ([#14621](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14621))
- Update KubeVirt CSI Driver Operator to v0.4.3 ([#14178](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14178))

Later one is required to use KubeVirt CPU allocation ratio feature ([#14298](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14298))
- A new field was introduced for KubeVirt provider in namespacedmode in enterprise edition to configure a mode for the deployed network policy in KubeVirt infrastructure clusters. Default mode is `allow` which allows by default all traffic except to other providernetwork subnets. The other option is `deny` which denies all traffic except to the usercluster apiserver, configured nameservers and between worker nodes ([#14390](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14390))
- Support KubeVirt CCM Load Balancer Interface Disabling ([#14521](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14521))

#### OpenStack
- Fix reconciliation loop for routers in Openstack provider by allowing updates to the `routerID` field ([#14420](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14420))
- User Clusters in Openstack can share a router, which is deleted only after all associated clusters are removed ([#14468](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14468))

- Add nginx config to increase header size for Dashboard and Dex ([#14579](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14579))
- EE: The default Policy Template Catalog can be deployed via `--deploy-default-policy-template-catalog` flag  ([#14472](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14472))
- A new `--limit-apps` flag has been added to the Kubermatic Installer, allowing users to limit which AppDefinitions are installed during the setup process. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of AppDefinition names. If the flag is not provided or the list is empty, all available AppDefinitions will be installed—provided the default app catalog is enabled ([#14569](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14569))
- KubeLB: New field extraArgs has been introduced for KubeLB at the Seed and cluster level. This field can be used to configure extra arguments for the KubeLB CCM ([#14564](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14564))

### Dashboard and API 

#### Breaking Changes

- The `usePodResourcesCPU` feature will replace `enableDedicatedCPUs` flag. In the time of deprecation both are taking effect but the new value will have more priority. When `enableDedicatedCPUs` is set to `false` which is also the default value, you need to set `usePodResourcesCPU` to `true` to keep the same behaviour as before for new created machines. If `enableDedicatedCPUs` was set to `true` nothing needs to be changed ([#7413](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/7413))
