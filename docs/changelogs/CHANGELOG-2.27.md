Previously, if the auditLogging field was enabled at the Seed level, it would override the same field at the Cluster level, resulting in the removal of the sidecar configuration ([#14145](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14145))
- Update Dashboard API to use correct OSP which is selected while creating a cluster ([#7217](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/7217))

## v2.27.0

**GitHub release: [v2.27.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.27.0)**

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.27/installation/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure user cluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters. A [full upgrade guide is available from the official documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.27/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.26-to-2.27/).

### Breaking Changes

- Remove CentOS as a supported operating system, since it has reached EOL ([#13906](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13906))
- VSphere credentials are now handled properly. For existing user cluster, this will change the credentials in machine-controller and OSM to `infraManagementUser` and  `infraManagementPassword` instead of `username` and `password` when specified. The latter one was always mounted to the before mentioned deployments in the past. ([#14087](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14087))


### ACTION REQUIRED

- A regression in 2.26.0 started overriding the `floatingIPPool` fields of OpenStack clusters with the default external network. If you are using a floating IP pool that is not the default external network, you might have to update `Cluster` objects manually after upgrading KKP to set the correct floating IP pool again ([#13834](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13834))

### API Changes

- Add `spec.componentsOverride.prometheus` to allow overriding Prometheus replicas and tolerations ([#13893](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13893))
- Tagged KKP releases will no longer tag the KKP images twice (with the Git tag and the Git hash), but only once with the Git tag. This is so that existing hash-based container images do not suddenly change when a Git tag is set and the release job is run. Users of tagged KKP releases are not affected by this change ([#13763](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13763))

### Supported Kubernetes Versions

- If autoscaler should continue to be managed by KKP, the cluster autoscaler app have to be installed to the user cluster. A purge of addon resources will be done before installing the app with helm ([#14057](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14057))
- [EE] It is now possible to use pre defined values in the KKP Enterprise Edition for applicationdefinition and applicationinstallation resources to specify cluster related values in the helm release value configuration ([#13945](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13945))

    * If you have provided configuration for new velero chart in KKP 2.26 for creating etcd backups and/or volume backups, please ensure to set `velero.backupsEnabled: true` and `velero.snapshotsEnabled: true` explicitly in your custom `values.yaml`
