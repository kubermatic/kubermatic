# Kubermatic 2.29

- [v2.29.0](#v2290)

## v2.29.0

**GitHub release: [v2.29.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.29.0)**

### Breaking Changes

- Bump cert-manager to v1.17.4 ([#14853](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14853))
	-  Cert-manager now hashes large RSA keys (3072 & 4096bit) with SHA-384 or SHA-512 respectively. If you are using these key sizes in your certificates, make sure your environment can handle the aforementioned hashing algorithms
	- Log messages that were not structured have now been replaced with structured logs. If you were matching on specific log strings, this could break your setup.

### New Features

- The newly introduced external application catalog manager was added to `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` command to be respected in offline environments and fetching catalog apps from an OCI image when the external manager is enabled was introduced for that purpose. ([#14995](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14995))
- Add [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue) to the default applications catalog ([#15004](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/15004))
- Non root device usage on worker nodes can now be enabled for containerd runtime by setting seed datacenter value `spec.datacenter.node.enableNonRootDeviceOwnership` to `true` ([#14891](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14891))
- The KubeLB tenant spec can now be defaulted at project level under `.spec.defaultTenantSpec` for KKP user cluster. For further details regarding this configuration, please take a look at [KubeLB tenant docs](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubelb/v1.1/references/ee/#tenantspec) ([#14819](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14819))
- Add the ability to configure `kube-state-metrics` in the KKP user clusters ([#14829](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14829))
- Promtail is replaced by Grafana Alloy as the log shipper in the KKP seed clusters ([#14767](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14767))
- Add an option to restrict project modification to the admins ([#14843](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14843))
- Overwrite system application images when `overwriteRegistry` is defined ([#14773](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14773))
- KubeLB: KKP defaulting will now enable KubeLB for a cluster if it's enforced at the datacenter level ([#14732](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14732))
- Allow setting registry settings of container-runtime deployed user cluster through Cluster CR ([#14745](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14745))
- Enable DynamicResourceAllocation (DRA) for user clusters ([#14872](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14872))
- You can now use annotations and labels on user clusters to enable templating during application installations. This allows for dynamic configuration using expressions like {{- if eq (index .Cluster.Annotations "env") "dev" }}custom1{{ else }}custom2{{ end }}. This feature is useful for more flexible multi-environment setups, for example ([#14877](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/14877))
