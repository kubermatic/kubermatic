## [v2.19.13](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.13)

### Action Required

- ACTION REQUIRED: Use `registry.k8s.io` instead of `k8s.gcr.io` for Kubernetes upstream images. It might be necessary to update firewall rules or mirror registries accordingly ([#11510](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11510))

### Bugfixes

- Fix missing etcd metrics in Grafana etcd dashboards and master/seed Prometheus by renaming to: `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`, `etcd_mvcc_delete_total`, `etcd_mvcc_put_total`, `etcd_mvcc_range_total`, `etcd_mvcc_txn_total` ([#11440](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11440))
- Prioritise public IP over private IP in front LoadBalancer service ([#11512](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11512))

## [v2.19.12](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.12)

This release includes updated Kubernetes versions that fix CVE-2022-3162 and CVE-2022-3294. For more information, see below. We strongly recommend upgrading to those Kubernetes patch releases as soon as possible.

### Bugfixes

- Fix regression that no longer created `Role` `kubermatic:secret:sa-etcd-launcher` for etcd-launcher-based restores ([#11241](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11241))

### Updates

- Add support for Kubernetes 1.22.16 and automatically upgrade existing 1.22.x clusters ([#11343](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11343))
    * Those Kubernetes patch releases fix CVE-2022-3162 and CVE-2022-3294, both in kube-apiserver: [CVE-2022-3162: Unauthorized read of Custom Resources](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/oR2PUBiODNA/m/tShPgvpUDQAJ) and [CVE-2022-3294: Node address isn't always verified when proxying](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/eR0ghAXy2H8/m/sCuQQZlVDQAJ).

### Upcoming Changes

- For the next series of KKP patch releases, image references will move from `k8s.gcr.io` to `registry.k8s.io`. This will be done to keep up with [latest upstream changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-release/3000-artifact-distribution). Please ensure that any mirrors you use are going to host `registry.k8s.io` and/or that firewall rules are going to allow access to `registry.k8s.io` to pull images before applying the next KKP patch releases. **This is not included in this patch release but just a notification of future changes.**

## [v2.19.11](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.11)

### Misc

- Set PriorityClassName of konnectivity-agent and openvpn-client to system-cluster-critical ([#11140](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/11140))

- Fix an issue with vSphere CSI driver using improved-csi-idempotency that's currently not supported by KKP ([#10793](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10793))
- Update KubeVirt logo to mark technology preview ([#4810](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/4810))

### Chore

- Add support for Kubernetes 1.22.15; existing clusters using these Kubernetes releases will be automatically updated as any previous version is affected by CVEs ([#11029](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11029))


## [v2.19.8](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.8)

### Updates

- Update Canal 3.21 version to v3.21.6 ([#10491](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/10491))
- Update machine-controller to v1.42.7 ([#10626](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/10626))


## [v2.19.7](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.7)

- Update machine-controller to v1.42.6 ([#10401](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/10401))

### Misc

- Add `--skip-dependencies` flag to kubermatic-installer that skips downloading Helm chart dependencies (requires chart dependencies to be downloaded already) ([#10348](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/10348))
- Use quay.io as the default registry for Canal CNI images, bump Canal v3.20 version to v3.20.5 ([#10305](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/10305))
- etcd backup files are named differently (`foo-YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` to `foo-YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss.db`) to improve compatibility with different storage solutions ([#10143](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/10143))


## [v2.19.6](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.6)

- Fix not referencing a custom CA bundle in vSphere CSI driver (regression from 2.18) ([#9989](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9989))
- Fix probes, resources and allow overriding resource requests/limits for Konnectivity proxy via components override in the Cluster resource ([#9911](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9911))


## [v2.19.5](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.5)

With this patch release, etcd for Kubernetes 1.22+ is upgraded to etcd 3.5.3. Data consistency issues as reported in previous release notes are fixed. Warnings and recommendations related to that can be considered withdrawn for this release.

- Add `vsphereCSIClusterID` feature flag for the cluster object. This feature flag changes the cluster-id in the vSphere CSI config to the cluster name instead of the vSphere Compute Cluster name provided via Datacenter config. Migrating the cluster-id requires manual steps ([#9202](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9202))
- Enable the "vsphereCSIClusterID" feature flag when running the CCM/CSI migration ([#9557](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9557))
- For Kubernetes 1.22 and higher, etcd is updated to v3.5.3 to fix data consistency issues as reported by upstream developers ([#9610](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9610))
- The flag `--kubelet-certificate-authority` (introduced in KKP 2.19) is not set for "kubeadm" / "bringyourown" user clusters anymore ([#9674](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9674))


## [v2.19.4](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.4)

This patch release enables etcd corruption checks on every etcd ring that is running etcd 3.5 (which applies to all user clusters with Kubernetes 1.22). This change is a [recommendation from the etcd maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ) due to issues in etcd 3.5 that can cause data consistency issues. The changes in this patch release will prevent corrupted etcd members from joining or staying in the etcd ring.

To replace a member in case of data consistency issues, please:

- Follow our documentation for [replacing an etcd member](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.19/cheat_sheets/etcd/replace_a_member/) if you are **not running etcd-launcher**.
- Delete the `PersistentVolume` that backs the corrupted etcd member to trigger the [automated recovery procedure](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.19/cheat_sheets/etcd/etcd-launcher/#automated-persistent-volume-recovery) if you **are using etcd-launcher**.

Please be aware we do not recommend enabling `etcd-launcher` on existing Kubernetes 1.22 environments at the time. This is due to the fact that the migration to `etcd-launcher` requires several etcd restarts and we currently recommend keeping the etcd ring as stable as possible (apart from the restarts triggered by this patch release to roll out the consistency checks).

### Misc

- For user clusters that use etcd 3.5 (Kubernetes 1.22 clusters), etcd corruption checks are turned on to detect [etcd data consistency issues](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766). Checks run at etcd startup and every 4 hours ([#9477](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9477))


## [v2.19.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.3)

### Breaking Changes
- ACTION REQUIRED: Secret name for S3 credentials updated to `kubermatic-s3-credentials`. If the secret `s3-credentials` was manually created instead of using the `minio` helm chart, new secret `kubermatic-s3-credentials` must be created. ([#9230](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9230))

### Bugfixes
- Fix LoadBalancer expose strategy for LBs with external DNS names instead of IPs ([#9105](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9105))
- `image-loader` parses custom versions in KubermaticConfiguration configuration files correctly ([#9154](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9154))
- Fix OpenVPNServerDown alerting rule to work as expected and not fire if Konnectivity is enabled. ([#9216](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9216))
- Fixes Preset API Body for preset creation and update API calls. ([#9300](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9300))
- Fix wrong CPU configs for the KubeVirt Virtual Machine Instances ([#1203](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/pull/1203))
- Fix vSphere VolumeAttachment cleanups during cluster deletion or node draining ([#1190](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/pull/1190))

### Misc
- Upgrade machine controller to v1.42.5 ([#9440](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9440))
- Support for `network:ha_router_replicated_interface` ports when discovering existing subnet router in Openstack ([#9176](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/9176))


## [v2.19.2](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.2)

### Breaking Changes

- ACTION REQUIRED: Restore correct labels on nodeport-proxy-envoy Deployment. Deleting the existing Deployment for each cluster with the `LoadBalancer` expose strategy if upgrading from affected versions (v2.19.1 or v2.18.6) is necessary ([#9060](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9060))

### Bugfixes

- Fix applying resource requirements when using incomplete overrides (e.g. specifying only limits, but no request for a container) ([#9045](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9045))


## [v2.19.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.1)

### Bugfixes

- ICMP rules migration only runs on Azure NSGs created by KKP ([#8843](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8843))
- Fix apiserver network policy: allow all egress DNS traffic from the apiserver ([#8788](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8788))
- Automatic upgrades from 1.19.\* to 1.20.13 work as intended now ([#8821](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8821))
- Fixes installation issue with charts/logging/loki (error evaluating symlink) ([#8823](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8823))
- Update example values and KubermaticConfiguration to respect OIDC settings ([#8851](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8851))
- Fix bad owner references for ClusterRoleBindings ([#8858](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8858))
- If a network is set in the Hetzner cluster spec, it is now correctly applied to generated machines ([#8872](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8872))
- fix AWS cloud provider cleanup sometimes getting stuck when cleaning up tags ([#8879](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8879))
- Helm charts using dependencies (loki, promtail, nginx, cert-manager) now have specified apiVersion v2 ([#9038](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9038))

### Misc

- Add endpoints to v2 KKP API to query Nutanix clusters, projects and subnets ([#8736](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8736))
- Do not reference Nutanix cluster in KKP API endpoint path for subnets ([#8906](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8906))
- Support custom pod resources for NodePort-Proxy pod for the user cluster ([#9018](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/9018))

### Known Issues

- Upgrading to this version is not recommended if the [`LoadBalancer` expose strategy](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.19/tutorials_howtos/networking/expose_strategies/) is used due to a bug in the `nodeport-proxy-envoy` Deployment template (#9059).
- Defining a component override that only gives partial resource configuration (only limits or requests) triggers an exception in the `seed-controller-manager`. If resources are defined in a component override, always define a full set of resource limits and requests to prevent this.


## [v2.19.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.19.0)

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.19/tutorials_howtos/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure usercluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters.

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Kubernetes (CVE-2021-44716, CVE-2021-44717, CVE-2021-3711, CVE-2021-3712, CVE-2021-33910) which have been fixed in Kubernetes 1.20.13, 1.21.8, 1.22.5.
Because of these updates, this KKP release includes automatic update rules for all 1.20/1.21/1.22 clusters older than these patch releases. This release also removes all affected Kubernetes versions from the list of supported versions. Once the automated controlplane updates have completed, an administrator must manually patch all vulnerable `MachineDeployment`s in all affected userclusters.

To lower the resource consumption on the seed clusters during the reconciliation / node rotation, it's recommended to adjust the `spec.seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` option in the `KubermaticConfiguration` to restrict the number of parallel updates.

The automatic update rules can, if needed, be overwritten using the `spec.versions.kubernetes.updates` field in the `KubermaticConfiguration`. See [#7825](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7824) for how the versions and updates are configured. It is however not recommended to deviate from the default and leave userclusters vulnerable.

### Highlights

- **All Your Clusters Under One Roof With External Cluster Support:** Import your existing AKS, EKS and GKE clusters and manage their entire lifecycle including upgrades and replica counts from our intuitive UI.
- **More Control Over Your Hybrid and Edge Deployments With OSM Support (Experimental):** KKP 2.19 adds experimental support for the [Operating System Manager](https://github.com/kubermatic/operating-system-manager) (OSM) to extend the functionality of the [Kubermatic Machine-Controller](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller). This gives you better control over your OS in hybrid cloud and edge environments.
- **Best-in-Class Networking with Cilium Support:** With Cilium CNI support, KKP users can now choose between the two most popular CNIs Canal and Cilium or simply add and manage a CNI of their choice; regardless of whether it’s supported by KKP or not.
- **Enhanced Control Plane Networking with Konnectivity Support:** To harness the power of Cilium with eBPF, KKP 2.19 comes with added Konnectivity support. It provides TCP level proxy for the control plane (seed cluster) to worker nodes (user cluster) communication. It is based on the upstream [apiserver-network-proxy project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-network-proxy) and replaces the older KKP-specific solution based on OpenVPN and network address translation.
- **Multiple Backup Locations for Improved Business Continuity:** As KKP Admin, you can now configure multiple backup destinations from the UI Admin Panel. Users can select daily, weekly, monthly or customized backup options.

### Breaking Changes

- ACTION REQUIRED: When upgrading from older KKP versions (before v2.19.0), additional flags:
  - `--migrate-upstream-nginx-ingress` is required to perform upgrade of nginx-ingress-controller. Ingress will be briefly unavailable during this process ([#8333](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8333))
  - `--migrate-upstream-cert-manager` is required to perform the migration of the `cert-manager`. During the upgrade, the chart is uninstalled completely so there is a short time when certificates will not be renewed.([#8392](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8392))
- ACTION REQUIRED: Set the default Service Accounts `automountServiceAccountToken` property to false for all KKP provided namespaces and kube-system ([#8344](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8344))
- cert-manager chart has been updated to use upstream chart from https://charts.jetstack.io as a dependency, updated to version 1.6.1
  - ACTION REQUIRED: configuration for cert-manager should now be included under key `cert-manager` in values.yaml file (changed from `certManager`)
  - ACTION REQUIRED: The chart will no longer configure ClusterIssuers. Refer to the documentation of cert-manager for configuration guide: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ ([#8392](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/8392))
- The old Docker repository at `quay.io/kubermatic/api` will not receive new images anymore, please use `quay.io/kubermatic/kubermatic` (CE) or `quay.io/kubermatic/kubermatic-ee` (EE) instead. This should only affect EE users who were still using the deprecated Helm chart ([#7922](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7922))
- BREAKING: `-dynamic-datacenters` was effectively already always true when using the KKP Operator and has now been removed as a flag. Support for handling a `datacenters.yaml` has been removed ([#7779](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7779))

#### Dashboard:

- Add multiple backup destinations.
  ACTION REQUIRED: KKP version 2.19 makes it possible to configure multiple destinations, therefore the current implementation of "backup buckets" will be deprecated soon. Migrate the configuration to a destination to keep using it in the future. It is reachable via the UI Admin Panel -> Backup Destinations ([#3911](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/issues/3911))
