## [v2.22.10](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.22.10)

### Action Required

- **ACTION REQUIRED (EE ONLY):** Update metering component to v1.0.5, fixing highly inaccurate data in cluster reports. Reports generated in KKP v2.23.2+ or v2.22.5+ do not represent actual consumption. Ad-hoc reports for time frames that need correct consumption data can be generated [by following our documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.23/tutorials-howtos/metering/#custom-reports) ([#12824](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12824))

### Bugfixes

- Extend project-synchronizer controller in `kubermatic-master-controller-manager` to propagate labels from Projects in the master cluster to Projects in the seed cluster. This fixes an issue where the metering report doesn't contain project-labels in separate master/seed setups ([#12793](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12793))
- Fix CPU Utilization graph showing no data for User Cluster MLA dashboard "Nodes Overview" ([#12817](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12817))
- Fix empty panels in Grafana dashboard "Resource Usage per Namespace" for Master/Seed MLA ([#12833](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12833))
- Fix Helm 3.13 failing to install the MLA Minio chart due to "resource name may not be empty" error ([#12806](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12806))

## [v2.22.9](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.22.9)

- Make uninstall for Applications idempotent ([#11622](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11622))
- Add validating and defaulting webhook for Application deployOptions ([#11633](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11633))
- Don't reuse values when upgrading Applications. The values defined in the ApplicationInstallation CR are the source of truth ([#11871](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11871))
- Fix bug preventing deletion of an ApplicationInstallation if the ApplicationDefinition was removed before ([#11888](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11888))

- Add keepalive-time Konnectivity setting + set keepalive to 1m by default ([#11502](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11502))
- Remove `KonnectivityService` feature gate & make Konnectivity generally available ([#11643](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11643))
- Update Konnectivity version to v0.0.35 ([#11657](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11657))

#### Kubermatic Operator

- The KKP operator can now perform the complete initial setup for new seed clusters. If MinIO/S3-exporter are not required, the KKP installer does not need to be used for setting up new / updating existing seed clusters ([#10795](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10795))

#### Presets

#### Resource Quotas (EE)

- Add a default project resource quota setting which can be set in KKP's global `KubermaticSettings`. By managing the default quota, for all the projects which do not have a custom quota already set, their ResourceQuota is created/updated/deleted ([#11582](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11582))
- Add functionality to configure default project quota ([#5565](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/5565))
- Add support for live quota update ([#5519](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/5519))
- The quota widget will be visible on the following places: Cluster template page, Add cluster from template dialog, Add/edit machine deployment dialog ([#5075](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/5075))

### Breaking Changes

- Use `registry.k8s.io` instead of `k8s.gcr.io` for Kubernetes upstream images. It might be necessary to update firewall rules or mirror registries accordingly ([#11079](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11079))
- KubeVirt: Manual migration of existing MD required. For more information [see our docs](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.22/architecture/supported-providers/kubevirt/kubevirt/#migration-from-kkp-221-to-kkp-222) ([#11430](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11430))
- KubeVirt: remove Flavor handling in favour of Instancetype/Preference. action required: manual update of the MD (refer to [our documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.22/architecture/supported-providers/kubevirt/kubevirt/#migration-from-kkp-221-to-kkp-222)) ([#11398](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11398))
- Remove experimental support for Thanos in the Prometheus Helm chart ([#11424](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11424))
- Cloud provider specific configurations are prohibited from seed-scoped default cluster templates; for existing seed-scoped default cluster templates these settings should be removed manually ([#11472](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11472))
- OperatingSystemProfiles and OperatingSystemConfigs have been moved to the user clusters ([#11710](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11710))
- CustomOperatingSystemProfile CRD is introduced for maintaining custom OSPs at the seed level. For more information [see our docs](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.22/tutorials-howtos/operating-system-manager/usage/#custom-operatingsystemprofiles) ([#11720](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11720))
    - OSP and OSC resources have been moved to user clusters. KKP will take care of migrating the existing resources
    - Custom OperatingSystemProfiles should now be created for the kind `CustomOperatingSystemProfile` instead of `OperatingSystemProfile` in the seed namespace
- Helm has been bumped to v3.11 for Applications. Due to a [CVE](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8) in the previous version, the helm template function [getHostByName](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/function_list/#network-functions) has been disabled (function will return an empty string). If you want to enable this function, you have to set `deployOptions.helm.enableDNS` to true and *verify* the function `getHostByName` is not being used in a chart to disclose any information you do not want to be passed to DNS servers.(c.f. CVE-2023-25165) ([#11887](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11887))
- vSphere user clusters will no longer have the field `.spec.cloud.vsphere.tagCategoryID` as it will get removed during the upgrade to KKP 2.22. To make KKP remember that it manages the tag category, please store the values of `.spec.cloud.vsphere.tagCategoryID` somewhere and add them back to the cluster post-upgrade as `.spec.cloud.vsphere.tags.categoryID` ([#11665](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11665)))

#### Removals

- Remove configuring of optional secondary disks to mount nodes ([#5439](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/5439))
- Remove support for Pod Security Policy Admission Plugin with k8s v1.25 ([#5212](https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard/pull/5212))
- Remove Docker as a supported container runtime

### API Changes

- Add external cluster EKS/AKS/GKE provider configuration into the `ExternalCluster` CRD ([#10982](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10982))
- The `address` field in the Cluster CRD was deprecated in KKP 2.21 and removed in this release. Use `status.address` instead. Existing clusters were migrated automatically by the seed-controller-manager in release 2.21 ([#10906](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10906))
- Instead of an `apiv1.NodeDeployment`, a `clusterv1alpha1.MachineDeployment` must be stored in the `kubermatic.io/initial-machinedeployment-request` annotation on new clusters ([#11339](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11339))
- Seed spec no longer requires `defaultDestination` for `etcdBackupRestore`; Omitting it allows to disable default etcd backups ([#11594](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11594))

### Deprecations

- machine-controller's built-in user data to provision new nodes is deprecated with this release and will be removed in a future release. OSM is the recommended way to generate user data.

### Cloud Providers

- The cloud-config and cloud-config-csi for user clusters is now stored in a `Secret` instead of `ConfigMap` on the seed cluster (in each user cluster namespace) ([#10759](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10759))
- By default, the `externalCloudProvider` feature will be turned on for all newly created clusters (if the provider supports it). Previously this only applied to Anexia/Kubevirt clusters (and to VSphere/Openstack/Azure clusters when using the KKP dashboard). Now the same rules apply no matter how the cluster is provisioned. The feature gate can still be explicitly set to `false`, but eventually all clusters must be migrated to the external CCM/CSI as in-tree support in Kubernetes is phased out ([#11095](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11095))

#### AWS

- The AWS and EKS cloud provider implementations now use the AWS Go SDK v2 to communicate with AWS ([#10922](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10922))
- Add support for the AWS External CCM & EBS CSI driver for Kubernetes 1.24+; newly created AWS clusters will use the `externalCloudProvider` feature flag automatically, existing clusters must be migrated manually ([#11102](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11102))
- Introduce a new field `disableIAMReconciling` in AWS cloud spec to disable IAM reconciliation ([#11272](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11272))
- Add support for dual-stack node IPs with AWS CCM ([#11285](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11285))

#### vSphere

- Remove the `overwriteCloudSpec` field from vSphere Machine Deployment ([#11315](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11315))
- Defaulting vSphere tag category from seed, when it is not specified in user cluster ([#11411](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11411))
- Rework vSphere user clusters tagging mechanism to adjust tags and tag categories creation and deletion, as part of the vSphere cloud provider resources reconciliation ([#11665](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11665))
- Update vSphere CSI driver to v2.7.0 ([#11724](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11724))

- Add support for GCP CSI Driver in Kubernetes 1.25+ clusters ([#11268](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11268))
- Fix updating GCP clusters from 1.24 to 1.25 ([#11904](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11904))

#### OpenStack

- Support for using server groups with OpenStack ([#11298](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11298))
- Add support for enforcing custom disk for OpenStack in KubermaticSettings ([#11338](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11338))
- Update OpenStack Cinder CSI to v1.24.5 and v1.25.3 ([#11454](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11454))
- `availabilityZone`, `dnsServers` and `nodeSizeRequirements` are now optional in the Openstack datacenter spec ([#11605](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11605))
- Fix OpenStack cloud provider tenant to project fields migration ([#11818](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11818))

#### DigitalOcean

- Add support for DigitalOcean external CCM ([#11464](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11464))

#### Anexia

- Extend disk configuration for provider Anexia ([#10816](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10816))

### MLA

- Installation of UserCluster MLA is now integrated with KKP installer via `kubermatic-installer deploy usercluster-mla` command ([#11008](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11008))
- Consul now uses the `kubermatic-fast` StorageClass by default ([#11291](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11291))
- UserCluster MLA: grafana-agent is now used instead of Prometheus inside the user clusters. Custom rules ConfigMaps should now be prefixed with `monitoring-scraping-` instead of `prometheus-scraping-` ([#11387](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11387))
- UserCluster MLA: grafana-agent is now used instead of Promtail inside the user clusters. No action is required ([#11426](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11426))
- Update MLA components ([#11580](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11580))

- KKP no longer supports SLES operating system ([#11711](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11711))

### etcd-launcher

- A race condition bug in `etcd-launcher` that can trigger on user cluster initialisation and that prevents the last etcd node from joining the etcd cluster has been fixed ([#10932](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10932))
- EtcdRestores are moved to a '`EtcdLauncherNotEnabled` phase if required etcd-launcher is not enabled ([#11115](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11115))
- Feature flag `EtcdLauncher` is enabled by default for `KubermaticConfiguration` ([#11684](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11684))

### Metrics & Alerts

- Fix missing etcd metrics in Grafana etcd dashboards and master/seed Prometheus by renaming to: `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`, `etcd_mvcc_delete_total`, `etcd_mvcc_put_total`, `etcd_mvcc_range_total`, `etcd_mvcc_txn_total` ([#11434](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11434))
- Monitoring: added etcd database size alerts: EtcdDatabaseQuotaLowSpace, EtcdExcessiveDatabaseGrowth, EtcdDatabaseHighFragmentationRatio ([#11507](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11507))
- Add unified event monitoring Grafana dashboard ([#11402](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11402))
- Enable alert-management using Grafana ([#11031](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11031))

- Add TunnelingAgentIP into ClusterNetwork part of the cluster API ([#11381](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11381))
- Implemented network-interface-manager for enhancing Tunneling expose strategy reliability ([#11432](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11432))
- Fix default tunnelingAgentIP for Tunneling expose strategy ([#11443](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11443))
- Change the Tunneling agent interface default IP from `192.168.30.10` to `100.64.30.10` ([#11504](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11504))
- Prioritise public IP over private IP in front LoadBalancer service ([#11512](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11512))

- Include tunneling agent IP in apiserver's TLS cert SANs ([#11932](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11932))

### Installer

- Add `--registry-prefix` flag to `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` command ([#11705](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11705))
- The `kubermatic-installer` will now reject installing a different KKP edition over an existing one (for example installing the Community Edition over a previous Enterprise Edition). This safety check can be disabled by adding `--allow-edition-change` to the installer. Installing the EE over the CE (i.e. upgrading) is supported, this change just prevents accidental mixups ([#11128](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11128))
- Updating KKP requires to change container runtime for all user clusters to containerd beforehand ([#11781](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11781))
- The KKP installer will ensure that neither the master nor any seed violate the KKP version skew policy, i.e. skipping a minor release during an upgrade is not permitted. Additionally, all seeds must be healthy for an upgrade to be possible. These changes are to ensure that smaller issues now do not lead to bigger problems during upgrades and migrations ([#10907](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/10907))
- `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` correctly picks up konnectivity and Kubernetes dashboard images ([#11148](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11148))
- Fix `--config` flag not being validated in `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` command in the KKP installer ([#11146](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11146))

- Fix `kubermatic-installer print` always printing the CE version of the example YAMLs ([#11129](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11129))
- Installer subcommand `mirror-images` correctly mirrors image `kubernetesui/metrics-scraper` now ([#11207](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11207))
- Observe configured addons tag suffix when extracting addon images in `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` command ([#11702](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11702))
- Remove dependency on `docker` binary when using `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` (removes the `--docker-binary` flag) ([#11717](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11717))
- Do not require addons flags in `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` and fall back to default addons image ([#11135](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11135))
- Ignore repository overrides in `KubermaticConfiguration` by default when mirroring images with `kubermatic-installer mirror-images` (can be disabled with `--ignore-repository-overrides=false`) ([#11703](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11703))
- Add `--skip-seed-validation` flag to installer to make it skip validating the given seeds (should be used with great caution only) ([#11874](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11874))

- External clusters on EKS now support assume role ([#11259](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11259))
- OPA integration: allow to define enforcementAction in KKP's constraint.EnforcementAction defines the action to take in response to a constraint being violated.By default, EnforcementAction is set to deny as the default behavior is to deny admission requests with any violation ([#11723](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/11723))
