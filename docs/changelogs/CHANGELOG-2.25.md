## v2.25.0

**GitHub release: [v2.25.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.25.0)**

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.25/installation/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure user cluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters. A [full upgrade guide is available from the official documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.25/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.24-to-2.25/).

### Action Required

- **ACTION REQUIRED:** VMware Cloud Director: Support for attaching multiple networks to a vApp
    - The field `ovdcNetwork` in `cluster` and `preset` CRDs is considered deprecated for VMware Cloud Director and `ovdcNetworks` should be used instead ([#12996](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12996))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** KubeLB(EE): The prefix for the tenant namespaces created in the management cluster has been updated from `cluster-` to `tenant-`. The tenants will be migrated automatically to the new namespace, load balancers, and services. The load balancer IPs need to be rotated and previous namespace cleaned up ([#13093](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13093))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** For velero helm chart upgrade related change. If you use `velero.restic.deploy: true`, you will see new daemonset `node-agent` running in `velero` namespace. You might need to remove existing daemonset named `restic` manually ([#12998](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12998))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** For velero helm chart upgrade. If running node-agent daemonset along with velero, then following replacement should be made in the velero's values.yaml before proceeding with upgrade ([#13118](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13118))
    - `velero.restic.deploy` with `velero.deployNodeAgent`
    - `velero.restic.resources` with `velero.nodeAgent.resources`
    - `velero.restic.nodeSelector` with `velero.nodeAgent.nodeSelector`
    - `velero.restic.affinity` with `velero.nodeAgent.affinity`
    - `velero.restic.tolerations` with `velero.nodeAgent.tolerations`
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** [User MLA] If you had copied `values.yaml` of loki-distributed chart to further customize it, then please cleanup your copy of `values.yaml` for user-mla to retain your customization only ([#12967](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12967))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** [User MLA] Cortex chart upgraded to resolve issues for cortex-compactor and improve stability of user-cluster MLA feature. Few actions are required to be taken to use new upgraded charts ([#12935](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12935)):
    - Refer to [Upstream helm chart values](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex-helm-chart/blob/v2.1.0/values.yaml) to see the latest default values.
    - Some of the values from earlier `values.yaml` are now incompatible with latest version. They are removed in the `values.yaml` in the current chart. But if you had copied the original values.yaml to customize it further, you may see that `kubermatic-installer` will detect such incompatible options and churn out errors and explain that action that needs to be taken.
    - The memcached-* charts are now subcharts of cortex chart so if you provided configuration for `memcached-*` blocks in your `values.yaml` for user-mla, you must move them under `cortex:` block.
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** [User MLA] minio has been updated to RELEASE.2023-04-28T18-11-17Z.
    - Before upgrading from older versions please refer to [the upgrade notes](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.25/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.24-to-2.25/) to verify if you're affected and how to move forward.

### Updates

- Update KKP images to Alpine 3.18; auxiliary single-binary images (alertmanager-authorization-server, network-interface-manager, s3-exporter and user-ssh-keys-agent) have been changed to use `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12` as the base image ([#12870](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12870))
- Update metering to v1.1.2, fixing an error when a custom CA bundle is used ([#13013](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13013))
- Update metrics-server to v0.7.0 ([#13056](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13056))
- Update telemetry to v0.5.0, now shipping with a distroless image ([#13055](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13055))
- Update to Go 1.22.1 ([#13152](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13152))
- Update to Kubernetes 1.29 / controller-runtime 0.17.1 ([#13066](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13066))
- Update Vertical Pod Autoscaler to 1.0 ([#12863](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12863))
- Increase the default resources for VPA components to prevent OOMs ([#12887](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12887))
- Update OSM and MC ([#13175](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13175))
    - Update operating-system-manager to [v1.5.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/operating-system-manager/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
    - Update machine-controller to [v1.59.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/releases/tag/v1.59.0)



### Cleanup

- Remove `CloudControllerReconcilledSuccessfully` (double L) Cluster condition, which was deprecated in KKP 2.21 and has since been replaced with `CloudControllerReconciledSuccessfully` (single L) ([#12867](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12867))
- Remove CriticalAddonsOnly toleration from node-local-dns DaemonSet as it has more general tolerations configured ([#12957](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12957))
- Some of high cardinality metrics were dropped from the User Cluster MLA prometheus. If your KKP installation was using some of those metrics for the custom Grafana dashboards for the user clusters, your dashboards might stop showing some of the charts ([#12756](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12756))
- Deprecate v1.11 and v1.12 Cilium and Hubble KKP Addons, as Cilium CNI is managed by Applications from version 1.13 ([#12848](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12848))


### Documentation

- Kube state metrics can be configured to get metrics for custom kubernetes resources ([#13027](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13027))
