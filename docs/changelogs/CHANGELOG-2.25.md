# Kubermatic 2.25

- [v2.25.0](#v2250)
- [v2.25.1](#v2251)

## [2.25.1](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/2.25.1)

### Bugfixes

- Add images for Velero and KubeLB to mirrored images list ([#13192](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13192))

### Design

- Improve compatibility with cluster-autoscaler 1.27.1+: Pods using temporary volumes are now marked as evictable ([#13180](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13180))

## [v2.25.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.25.0)

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.25/installation/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure user cluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters. A [full upgrade guide is available from the official documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.25/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.24-to-2.25/).

### Action Required

- **ACTION REQUIRED:** VMware Cloud Director: Support for attaching multiple networks to a vApp
    - The field `ovdcNetwork` in `cluster` and `preset` CRDs is considered deprecated for VMware Cloud Director and `ovdcNetworks` should be used instead ([#12996](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12996))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** KubeLB(EE): The prefix for the tenant namespaces created in the management cluster has been updated from `cluster-` to `tenant-`. The tenants will be migrated automatically to the new namespace, load balancers, and services. The load balancer IPs need to be rotated and previous namespace cleaned up ([#13093](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13093))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** For velero helm chart upgrade related change. If you use `velero.restic.deploy: true`, you will see new daemonset `node-agent` running in `velero` namespace. You might need to remove existing daemonset named `restic` manually ([#12998](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12998))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** For velero helm chart upgrade. If running node-agent daemonset along with velero, then following replacement should be made in the velero's values.yaml before proceeding with upgrade ([#13118](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/13118))
    - `velero.restic.deploy` with `velero.deployNodeAgent`
    - `velero.restic.resources` with `velero.nodeAgent.resources`
    - `velero.restic.nodeSelector` with `velero.nodeAgent.nodeSelector`
    - `velero.restic.affinity` with `velero.nodeAgent.affinity`
    - `velero.restic.tolerations` with `velero.nodeAgent.tolerations`
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** [User MLA] If you had copied `values.yaml` of loki-distributed chart to further customize it, then please cleanup your copy of `values.yaml` for user-mla to retain your customization only ([#12967](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12967))
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** [User MLA] Cortex chart upgraded to resolve issues for cortex-compactor and improve stability of user-cluster MLA feature. Few actions are required to be taken to use new upgraded charts ([#12935](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/12935)):
    - Refer to [Upstream helm chart values](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex-helm-chart/blob/v2.1.0/values.yaml) to see the latest default values.
    - Some of the values from earlier `values.yaml` are now incompatible with latest version. They are removed in the `values.yaml` in the current chart. But if you had copied the original values.yaml to customize it further, you may see that `kubermatic-installer` will detect such incompatible options and churn out errors and explain that action that needs to be taken.
    - The memcached-* charts are now subcharts of cortex chart so if you provided configuration for `memcached-*` blocks in your `values.yaml` for user-mla, you must move them under `cortex:` block.
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** [User MLA] minio has been updated to RELEASE.2023-04-28T18-11-17Z.
    - Before upgrading from older versions please refer to [the upgrade notes](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.25/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.24-to-2.25/) to verify if you're affected and how to move forward.
