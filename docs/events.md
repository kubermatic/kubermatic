# Events

## Guidelines

We're following the [guidelines from Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/b3349d5b1354df814b67bbdee6890477f3c250cb/contributors/devel/event-style-guide.md).

## Handling old code

We've not followed that guidelines in the past, thus we might encounter code which does not apply to the above mentioned guidelines.
As code which handles event's might be more complex(Compared with logs), dedicated PR's should be issued to change old code.
