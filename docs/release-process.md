# Release

This document explains our process and requirements for creating a new Kubermatic release.

## Testing prior releasing

This section provides a non-exhaustive minimal list of functionality that must be validated prior
to creating a new release. All these tests must be executed with every supported minor Kubernetes version.

1. Conformance tests on all supported providers (AWS, Openstack, Digitalocean, VSphere, Azure, Hetzner)
1. Cloud provider functionality `service type LoadBalancer` on all providers that support it (AWS, Openstack, Azure)
1. Cloud provider functionality `PersistentVolume` on all providers that support it (AWS, Openstack, Vsphere, Azure)
1. HorizontalPodAutoscaler

## Releasing a new version

This section covers the process to create a new Kubermatic release. Reflects the procedure as of 2020-09-16.

### Major|Minor release

1. Kubernetes lifecycle
    - Ensure ConfigMap for new kubelet version is added
    - Ensure RBAC for that ConfigMap is added
    - Ensure end-of-life Kubernetes has been disabled
1. Ensure all providers' conformance tests run
1. Branching out
    - A release branch(example: `release/v2.15`) has been created in:
      - https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic
      - https://github.com/kubermatic/dashboard
1. Duplicate the `main` documentation for KKP in https://github.com/kubermatic/docs
   (i.e. copy the content, data, etc. files and adjust accordingly)
1. Adjust postsubmit jobs in the infra repo to start running for
   the new release branch
1. Tagging
    - Tag the release in `dashboard` repo
    - Ensure it's built and pushed successfully
    - Tag the matching release in `kubermatic` repo
    - Ensure it's built and pushed successfully
1. Documentation:
    - Update changelog (using `hack/changelog-gen.sh`)
      - Remember to include changes from the `dashboard` repo as well, if any
    - Copy it over to matching chapters and branches in docs
      - Strip the Github links from the GCHL version
