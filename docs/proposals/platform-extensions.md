# Platform Extension

**Author**: Marcin Franczyk, Sascha Haase, Moritz Bracht, Sankalp Rangare

**Status**: Draft proposal.

## Goals

This proposal is to introduce a new platform-extension mechanism which will
provide a more flexible and more transparent way to manage the life-cycle of
extensions in KKP than the current Addon mechanism.

## Non-Goals

Replacing the current Addon mechanism is not in the scope of this proposal, but
could be a long-term result.

## Motivation and Background

When new core concepts are being introduced to KKP we currently face two
questions:

1. How is it going to be implemented?
2. How is it going to be integrated?

To be able to focus on the implementation part, the integration should be
streamlined. The current approach of extending the functionality of user
clusters (Addons) has some limitations which makes it not suitable to use as a
general approach for extensions.

### Current Addon Mechanism

There are *Default Addons*, *Accessible Addons* and *Custom Addons*. Default
Addons are installed on every user cluster, Accessible Addons are available for
installation or provide a configuration interface for Default Addons and Custom
Addons are like Accessible Addons, but provided by the users themselves.  To
add Custom Addons to the catalog of installable Addons the user needs to
provide manifest templates in a docker image that is based on Kubermatic's
provided `kubermatic/addons` docker image.

To select, which Accessible and Custom addons are deployed to all user
clusters, they are being added in the KKP configuration. The KKP operator
reconciles the installation to match the configuration.

#### Limitations

This mechanism is suitable for immutable core components like OpenVPN, Canal or
kube-proxy, but has its limitations with more complex components:

* Extensibility
  * Default Addons and Accessible Addons are shipped in the same medium (docker
    image)
  * Adding Custom Addons is rather complex
* The life-cycle of Addons is tied to the life-cycle of KKP
  * User provided manifest images need to be rebuilt on every KKP upgrade
* No control over dependencies
  * When Addons depend on other Addons the order of installation can not be
    defined. All Addons will be installed at once and it takes several
    reconciliation loops to get everything ready.
* Installing more complex K8s addons can lead to complications
  * If the shipped manifests of an Addon contains multiple CRDs and CRs it
    takes multiple reconciliation loops until all manifests are successfully
    applied. This results in several warnings in the cluster event log.

## Requirements for Implementations

*The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.*

1. Extension source
	* (1.1) The source for extensions MUST be independent from the KKP
	  installation, so rather a catalog than a shipped docker image containing
	  manifests.
	* (1.2) The source for extensions MUST be extensible by external sources.
	  For example by providing a list of additional catalogs.
2. Dependency management
	* (2.1) It MUST be possible to define or resolve dependencies between
	  extensions, so the order of installation can be considered.
3. Complex extensions
	* (3.1) It MUST be possible to install extension-operators that handle the
	  installation of complex extensions.
4. Life-cycle management
	* (4.1) The life-cycle of native extensions MUST be tied to the life-cycle
	  of KKP.
	* (4.2) The life-cycle of external extensions SHOULD be tied to the
	  life-cycle of Kubernetes.
5. Maintainability at runtime
	* (5.1) External extensions MUST be up- and downgradable at runtime
	  dependent on Kubernetes version.
	* (5.2) External extensions MUST be uninstallable at runtime.
6. Access to cluster data
	* (6.1) Extension MAY need access to data from the Master Cluster. For
	  example a mapping of cluster users to SSH keys - to be used for
	  authentication within an extension.

## Competitive Landscape

There are already some solutions out there that solve the problem of extending
Kubernetes clusters. In the following we want to take a look at those and see
if we can apply some of their concepts to solve our requirements.

### KubeApps

[KubeApps](https://kubeapps.com/docs/) offers two ways to extend a kubernetes
cluster. Either directly via Helm charts or indirectly by adding operators to
handle the life-cycle of extensions.

Helm charts can be installed from public and private Helm repositories. By
default some public Helm chart repositories are enabled, but other public
repositories can be added easily. Private repositories like ChartMuseum, Harbor
or Artifactory (pro) can also be added. There is a controller that watches an
AppRepository CR and creates a cronjob for each. It repeatedly scans the Helm
charts available and stores the chart's metadata in KubeApps internal database.

Installation of Helm charts happens imperatively through the KubeApps API.
Their roadmap states that they want to create plugin-based system and support
both this imperative approach and also a declarative approach by adding flux as
a plugin.

If [OLM](https://olm.operatorframework.io) is installed the KubeApps Dashboard
also allows to install operators from the operator hub (and other sources added
to OLM). Once an operator is installed, applications managed by this operator
get listed along with existing helm charts and are ready to be installed.

### Flux

[Flux](https://fluxcd.io) is a "GitOps toolkit" that provides tools to manage
applications based on helm charts in a fully declarative approach.

An operator watches HelmRelease CRs and creates artifacts from charts found in
Git repositories, Helm repositories and S3 buckets. Another operator watches
HelmChart CRs which use HelmRelease CRs as kind of template. It checks for the
availability of the referenced chart artifact and all required dependencies.
It then fetches the artifact and takes all required Helm actions like install
or upgrade to reach the desired state of the application. Helm test actions are
also executed if they are defined. Retries, rollback or uninstall are executed
as configured if any Helm action fails.

### Operator Lifecycle Manager

[OLM](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/) provides a declarative way to
handle the lifecycle and dependencies of Kubernetes operators.

With the operator SDK simple operators can be generated directly from Helm
charts.  After installing these operators CR of the corresponding kind has to
be created so the operator takes care of bringing the application up.

Operators from operatorhub can be installed natively. The catalog of operators
can be extended by 3rd-party catalogs or by bundeling own operators into
catalogs.

### Kyma Service Calatlog: Helm Broker

[Kyma's Helm Broker](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/helm-broker/) is
an abstraction layer on top of Helm to provide Helm chart based services in
[Kyma's Service
Catalog](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/service-catalog/).

Helm charts get wrapped with all necessary information and metadata into
so-called Addons. These addons are bundled in repositories and exposed as
Service Classes in the Service Catalog.

To provision such a Service in the cluster the user creates a set of custom
resources (ServiceInstance, ServiceBinding, ServiceBindingUsage). The service
broker then creates an instance of that service and injects a set of user
credentials to make it ready to use.

## Implementation Proposals

* [Helm magager](./platform-extension-implementation-helm-manager.md)
* tbd.

## Open questions

* Is there really a difference between “native extensions” (like Eventing) and
  “external extensions” (like KubeVirt)? If so, does this difference justify
  different life-cycles?

## Glossary

* Addon - KKP extension in the "old sense"
* Catalog - Generalization for repository/registry
* Extension - KKP extension in the "new sense"
* External extension - Extension developed by third parties
* KKP - Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform
* Native extension - Extension developed and supported directly by Kubermatic
