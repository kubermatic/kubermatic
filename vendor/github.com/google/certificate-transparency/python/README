To run the python scripts

1. Install the following additional packages
gflags (python_gflags if using easy_install)
gviz-api-py (easy_install 'https://google-visualization-python.googlecode.com/files/gviz_api_py-1.8.2.tar.gz')
requests (at least version 1.0)
protobuf
ecdsa
mock
twisted (at least 12.1; tested with 13.2)
pycrypto (at least 2.5; tested with 2.6.1)

If you use pip, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Install the protoc compiler from https://github.com/google/protobuf/

3. Run 'make' in the parent python/ directory to
generate the Python versions of CT protocol buffers.

4. Make sure the python/ directory is on your Python path

5. Run 'make test' in the parent python/ directory to run unit tests.

6. Try out the client tools:

 a. Choose a location for your SQLite database. The default location is
    "/tmp/ct". If you prefer another location then you have to modify
    command line flags accordingly when launching the scripts.

 b. Launch ct/dashboard/dashboard.py
    This launches a simple web server for displaying log data, and a
    background process for probing the log(s) periodically. The default
    output is at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the default configuration
    file for logs to probe is at config/logs.config
