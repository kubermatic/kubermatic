# The docs have been moved!

The documentation for Docker Machine has been merged into
[the general documentation repo](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io).

The docs for Docker Machine are now here:
https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/tree/master/machine

Please submit pull requests for unpublished features on the `vnext-machine` branch (https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/tree/vnext-machine).

If you submit a PR to this codebase that has a docs impact, create a second docs PR on `docker.github.io`. Use the docs PR template provided (coming soon - watch this space).

PRs for typos, additional information, etc. for already-published features should be labeled as `okay-to-publish` (we are still settling on a naming convention, will provide a label soon). You can submit these PRs either to `vnext-machine` or directly to `master` on `docker.github.io`

As always, the docs in the general repo remain open-source and we appreciate
your feedback and pull requests!
