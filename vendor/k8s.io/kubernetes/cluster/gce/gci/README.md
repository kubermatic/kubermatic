# Google Container-VM Image (GCI)

[GCI](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/vm-image/) is a container-optimized OS image for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We built GCI primarily for running Google services on GCP. Unlike the open preview version of container-vm, Google Container-VM Image is based on the open source Chromium OS project, allowing us greater control over the build management, security compliance, and customizations for GCP.
