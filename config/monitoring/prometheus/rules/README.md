# Prometheus Alerting/Recording Rules

When editing these rules, make sure to not touch the generated files
in this directory, but rather edit the files in `src/`. Afterwards,
ensure to run `make` in the monitoring directory to re-generate the
alert/rules files.

When adding/removing alerts or changing the runbook information, make
sure to also update the documentation repo by running `make runbook`
in that repository.
