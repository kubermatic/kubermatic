      message: Kubermatic controller manager in {{ $labels.namespace }} is experiencing too many errors.

      steps:
      - Check the controller-manager pod's logs.

  - alert: KubermaticClusterDeletionTakesTooLong
    annotations:
      message: Cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} is stuck in deletion for more than 30min.
      runbook_url: https://docs.kubermatic.io/monitoring/runbook/#alert-kubermaticclusterdeletiontakestoolong
    expr: (time() - max by (cluster) (kubermatic_cluster_deleted)) > 30*60
    for: 0m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    runbook:
      steps:
      - Check the machine-controller's logs via `kubectl -n cluster-XYZ logs -l 'app=machine-controller'` for errors related to cloud provider integrations.
        Expired credentials or manually deleted cloud provider resources are common reasons for failing deletions.
      - Check the cluster's status itself via `kubectl describe cluster XYZ`.
      - If all resources have been cleaned up, remove the blocking finalizer (e.g. `kubermatic.io/delete-nodes`) from the cluster resource.
      - If nothing else helps, manually delete the cluster namespace as a last resort.
