      steps:
      - Check the installed Helm releases via `helm --tiller-namespace kubermtic-installer ls`.
      - If all releases are status `DEPLOYED`, make sure the helme-exporter is looking at the correct Tiller by checking
        the `values.yaml` flag `helmExporter.tillerNamespace`.
      - If Helm cannot repair the chart automatically, delete/purge the chart (`helm delete --purge [RELEASE]`) and
        re-install the chart again. Re-installing charts will not affect any existing data in existing PersistentVolumeClaims.
