### Updates file
#
# Contains a list of allowed updated
#
# Each update may optionally contain `automatic: true` in which case the
# controlplane of all clusters whose version matches the `from` directive
# will get updated to the `to` version. If `automatic: true` is set, the
# `to` version must be a version and not a version range.
#
# All `to` versions must be configured in the `versions.yaml`.
#
# Also, updates may contan `automaticNodeUpdate: true`, in which case
# Nodes will get updates as well. `automaticNodeUpdate: true` sets
# `automatic: true` as well if not yet the case, because Nodes may not have
# a newer version than the controlplane.
