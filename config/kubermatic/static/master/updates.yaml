### Updates file
#
# Contains a list of allowed updated
#
# Each update may optionally contain 'automatic: true' in which case the
# controlplane of all clusters whose version matches the 'from' directive
# will get updated to the 'to' version. If 'automatic: true' is set, the
# 'to' version must be a version and not a version range.
#
# All 'to' versions must be configured in the 'versions.yaml'.
#
# Also, updates may contan 'automaticNodeUpdate: true', in which case
# Nodes will get updates as well. 'automaticNodeUpdate: true' sets
# 'automatic: true' as well if not yet the case, because Nodes may not have
# a newer version than the controlplane.
#
# REMEMBER TO CHANGE BOTH:
# - DefaultUpdatesYAML in api/pkg/controller/operator/common/defaults.go
# - config/kubermatic/static/master/updates.yaml
