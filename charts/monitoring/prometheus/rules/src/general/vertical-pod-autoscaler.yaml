  # These rules provide metrics to be consumed by Kubernetes' VPA. The VPA only needs a tiny fraction
  # of the labels available on the container_* metrics, so we reduce them with the inner query to
  # only contain pod name, namespace and name.
  # Because the VPA does not allow to change the metric name it queries, but only the job selector,
  # we "cheat" by re-using the same metric name and injecting a custom job ("cadvisor-vpa") label.
