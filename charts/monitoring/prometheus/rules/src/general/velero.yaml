      steps:
      - Check if a backup is really in "InProgress" state via `velero -n velero backup get`.
      - Check the backup logs via `velero -n velero backup logs [BACKUP_NAME]`.
      - Depending on the backup, find the pod and check the processes inside that pod or any sidecar containers.

    annotations:
      message: There has not been a successful backup for schedule {{ $labels.schedule }} in the last 24 hours.

    labels:
      severity: warning
    runbook:
      steps:
      - Check if really no backups happened via `velero -n velero backup get`.
      - If a backup failed, check its logs via `velero -n velero backup logs [BACKUP_NAME]`.
      - If a backup was not even triggered, check the Velero server's logs via `kubectl -n velero logs -l 'name=velero-server'`.
      - Make sure the Velero server pod has not been rescheduled and possibly opt to schedule it on a stable node using a node affinity.
