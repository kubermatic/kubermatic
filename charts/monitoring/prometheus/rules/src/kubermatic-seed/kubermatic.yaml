              Expired credentials or manually deleted cloud provider resources are common reasons for failing deletions.
            - Check the cluster's status itself via `kubectl describe cluster XYZ`.
            - If all resources have been cleaned up, remove the blocking finalizer (e.g. `kubermatic.io/delete-nodes`) from the cluster resource.
            - If nothing else helps, manually delete the cluster namespace as a last resort.

              Manually deleted resources inside of the user cluster is a common reason for failing deletions.
            - If all resources of the addon inside the user cluster have been cleaned up, remove the blocking finalizer (e.g. `cleanup-manifests`) from the addon resource.
