  - alert: KubermaticTooManyUnhandledErrors
    annotations:
      message: Kubermatic controller manager in {{ $labels.namespace }} is experiencing too many errors.
      runbook_url: https://docs.loodse.com/kubermatic/master/monitoring/runbook/#alert-kubermatictoomanyunhandlederrors
    expr: sum(rate(kubermatic_controller_manager_unhandled_errors_total[5m])) > 0.01
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    runbook:
      steps:
      - Check the controller-manager pod's logs.

  - alert: KubermaticClusterDeletionTakesTooLong
    annotations:
      message: Cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} is stuck in deletion for more than 30min.
      runbook_url: https://docs.loodse.com/kubermatic/master/monitoring/runbook/#alert-kubermaticclusterdeletiontakestoolong
    expr: (time() - max by (cluster) (kubermatic_cluster_deleted)) > 30*60
    for: 0m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    runbook:
      steps:
      - Check the machine-controller's logs via `kubectl -n cluster-XYZ logs -l 'app=machine-controller'` for errors related to cloud provider integrations.
        Expired credentials or manually deleted cloud provider resources are common reasons for failing deletions.
      - Check the cluster's status itself via `kubectl describe cluster XYZ`.
      - If all resources have been cleaned up, remove the blocking finalizer (e.g. `kubermatic.io/delete-nodes`) from the cluster resource.
      - If nothing else helps, manually delete the cluster namespace as a last resort.

  - alert: KubermaticAddonDeletionTakesTooLong
    annotations:
      message: Addon {{ $labels.addon }} in cluster {{ $labels.cluster }} is stuck in deletion for more than 30min.
      runbook_url: https://docs.loodse.com/kubermatic/master/monitoring/runbook/#alert-kubermaticaddondeletiontakestoolong
    expr: (time() - max by (cluster,addon) (kubermatic_addon_deleted)) > 30*60
    for: 0m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    runbook:
      steps:
        - Check the kubermatic controller-manager's logs via `kubectl -n kubermatic logs -l 'role=controller-manager'` for errors related to deletion of the addon.
          Manually deleted resources inside of the user cluster is a common reason for failing deletions.
        - If all resources of the addon inside the user cluster have been cleaned up, remove the blocking finalizer (e.g. `cleanup-manifests`) from the addon resource.

  - alert: KubermaticControllerManagerDown
    annotations:
      message: KubermaticControllerManager has disappeared from Prometheus target discovery.

    labels:

    runbook:
      steps:
      - Check the Prometheus Service Discovery page to find out why the target is unreachable.
      - Ensure that the controller-manager pod's logs and that it is not crashlooping.

  - alert: OpenVPNServerDown
    annotations:
      message: There is no healthy OpenVPN server in cluster {{ $labels.cluster }}.

  # This is a dummy alert that is triggered for paused clusters to inhibit all other alerts from such clusters.
  # The label_replace() is used to create a new "cluster" label that will be used for the inhibitions as well.
