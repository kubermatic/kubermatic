  # The list of rule files to load; if you use the `volumes`
  # directive below to mount your own ConfigMap or Secret into
  # Prometheus, you will want to extend this list to load your
  # own rule files. You can remove the predefined path to
  # effectively disable the stock recordings and alerts.
  ruleFiles:
  - /etc/prometheus/rules/general-*.yaml
  - /etc/prometheus/rules/kubermatic-seed-*.yaml
  # If you are running a non-master cluster, you should comment the
  # following line to disable master components alerts.
  - /etc/prometheus/rules/kubermatic-master-*.yaml
  # If you run in an environment where access to Kubernetes
  # scheduler and controller-manager is not possible (like GKE),
  # disable the expression below to not create false alerts
  # for missing/unhealthy components.
  - /etc/prometheus/rules/managed-*.yaml

  # If user cluster MLA is enabled, uncomment the following line
  # to enable alerting for cortex and loki.
  # - /etc/prometheus/rules/usercluster-mla-*.yaml

  # Optionally add some more recording/alerting rules; the structure
  # beneath `rules` is identical to regular rules files as documented
  # in https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/
  # For larger collections of rules, consider using the custom volume
  # approach shown further down in the `volumes` section.
  #rules:
  #  groups:
  #    - name: myrules
  #      rules:
  #      - alert: DatacenterIsOnFire
  #        expr: temperature{cpu} > 100
  #        for: 5m

  # If you prefer to manage your recording/alerting rules in your
  # own ConfigMaps or Secrets, you can use this section to mount
  # those into the Prometheus pods. Remember to extend the `ruleFiles`
  # section above to have your files be loaded into Prometheus.
  # For each volume, specify either a configMap name or a secretName,
  # never both.
  #volumes:
  #- name: initech-alerting-rules
  #  mountPath: /initech/alerts
  #  configMap: initech-alerting-rules-configmap
  #- name: initech-recording-rules
  #  mountPath: /initech/recordings
  #  secretName: initech-recording-rules-secret

  # Optionally configure remote write from Prometheus instances to given targets.
