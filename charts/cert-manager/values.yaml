    # Commenting this to fix helm schema validation error ` webhook: Additional property injectAPIServerCA is not allowed` - To be reviewed.
    # Note: This field has be removed as part of the cert-manager 0.15.0 release. Check https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/2743/files#diff-719152aa560e98613908347a8a4426abb52974938a36e334d066bf084daf1716L198-L204
    # If true, the apiserver's CA bundle will be automatically injected into the
    # webhook's ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource by the CA injector.
    # in future this will default to false, as the apiserver can use the loopback
    # configuration caBundle to talk to itself in kubernetes 1.11+
    # see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62649

    # The port that the webhook should listen on for requests.
    # In GKE private clusters, by default kubernetes apiservers are allowed to
    # talk to the cluster nodes only on 443 and 10250. so configuring
    # securePort: 10250, will work out of the box without needing to add firewall
    # rules or requiring NET_BIND_SERVICE capabilities to bind port numbers <1000
