                  "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to

                  "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a
                  set of endpoints rather than a stable IP.
                  "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                  routes to the clusterIP.
                  "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an
                  external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes
                  to the clusterIP.

                            This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax.
                            Valid values are either:


                            * Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as per
                            RFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).


                            * Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:
                              * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-
                              * 'kubernetes.io/ws'  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455
                              * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455


                            * Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as
                            mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.

                            The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL.
                            All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering
                            the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the
                            EndpointPort.
                            Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service.

                            NodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is
                            specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the
                            operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this
                            Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a
                            Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be
                            wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type
                            from NodePort to ClusterIP).

                            Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME.
                            If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the

                            of the 'port' field is used (an identity map).
                            This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be
                            omitted or set equal to the 'port' field.
