# oauth Helm Chart

This Helm chart installs [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) used, among other things, for authentication in KKP.

## Deprecation Notice

This chart has been deprecated starting from KKP 2.27 and should not be used anymore. Instead use the new `dex` chart that is based on the official upstream Helm chart.

When upgrading an existing KKP setup, please refer to the [KKP upgrade guide](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/main/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.26-to-2.27/#dex-v242).
