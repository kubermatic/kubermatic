# oauth Helm Chart

This Helm chart installs [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) used, among other things,
for authentication in KKP.

## Deprecation Notice

This chart should not be used anymore, instead use the new `dex` chart. The new
chart is based on the official upstream Helm chart.

When upgrading an existing KKP setup, please refer to the [KKP upgrade guide](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/main/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.25-to-2.26/#dex-240).
