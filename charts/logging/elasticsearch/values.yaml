    # When the sum of master and data nodes is 1, the chart will deploy a cluster
    # with single-node mode enabled. In this mode there is no discovery and no
    # separation between masters and data nodes anymore. You also lose any redundancy
    # and should not use this for production workloads.
    # Note that you should set data=1 and master=0 if you need a single-node cluster.
    # Scaling the StatefulSets via kubectl will *not change the mode*, so to scale
    # up you need to re-deploy the chart with updated replica counts. Once the
    # regular cluster mode is enabled, using kubectl to scale up and down is fine.
