# This file is not just a Helm values.yaml, but also used by the e2e test for constructing
# a matching OIDC client for fetching an access token. The file is also used by the dashboard
# when setting up Kubermatic, so the configuration must match.
# NB: Our Go code does not load the default values.yaml, so especially for the ingress
# config you cannot rely on defaults.
