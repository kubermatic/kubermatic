Package seedstatuscontroller contains a controller that is responsible
for managing the basic parts of the SeedStatus:

  - status.versions.kubermatic
  - status.versions.cluster
  - status.conditions.SeedConditionKubeconfigValid
  - status.phase
  - status.clusters

It does so by checking the kubeconfig for a seed and combining the other
conditions set by other controllers to compute the current phase.
