                    PolicySpec is the policy spec of the Kyverno Policy we want to apply on the cluster.

                    The structure of this spec should follow the rules defined in Kyverno
                    [Writing Policies Docs](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/).

                    For example, a simple policy spec could be defined as:

                       policySpec:
                         validationFailureAction: Audit
                         background: true

                         - name: check-for-labels
                           match:
                             any:
                             - resources:
                                 kinds:
                                 - Pod
                           validate:
                             message: "The label `app.kubernetes.io/name` is required."
                             pattern:
                               metadata:
                                 labels:
