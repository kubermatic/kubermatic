            Addon specifies a cluster addon. Addons can be installed into user clusters
            to provide additional manifests for CNIs, CSIs or other applications, which makes
            addons a necessary component to create functioning user clusters.
            Addon objects must be created inside cluster namespaces.

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.
