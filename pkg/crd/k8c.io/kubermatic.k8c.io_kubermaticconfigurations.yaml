                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                              and deleted when the pod is removed.

                              Use this if:
                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                 tracking are needed,
                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                              of an individual pod.

                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                              more information.

                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                              persistent volumes at the same time.

                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                  This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                                  to the PVC after it has been created.

                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                          provisioner.
                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                              The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                              - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                              - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                              - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                              The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                              A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                              The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                              The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                              The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                              Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                              The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                  Policy for pulling OCI objects. Possible values are:
                                  Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                  Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                  IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                  Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                  Behaves in the same way as pod.spec.containers[*].image.
                                  Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.
