                APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
                Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
                may reject unrecognized values.

                        This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                        allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                        almost certainly wrong.
