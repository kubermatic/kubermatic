  title: Disallow Latest Tag
  description: | 
      The ':latest' tag is mutable and can lead to unexpected errors if the
      image changes. A best practice is to use an immutable tag that maps to
      a specific version of an application Pod. This policy validates that the image
      specifies a tag and that it is not called `latest`.
