  title: Require Labels
  description: | 
      Define and use labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.
      A common set of labels allows tools to work collaboratively, describing objects in a common manner that
      all tools can understand. The recommended labels describe applications in a way that can be
      queried. This policy validates that the label `app.kubernetes.io/name` is specified with some value.
