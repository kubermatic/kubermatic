  title: Restrict Ingress defaultBackend
  description: | 
      An Ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend. The defaultBackend
      is conventionally a configuration option of the Ingress controller and is not specified in
      your Ingress resources. If none of the hosts or paths match the HTTP request in the Ingress
      objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend. In a multi-tenant environment, you
      want users to use explicit hosts, they should not be able to overwrite the global default backend
      service. This policy prohibits the use of the defaultBackend field.
