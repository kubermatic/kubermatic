DefaultPolicyController ensures that all PolicyTemplates marked as enforced
or default are automatically applied to the appropriate clusters in the form of
PolicyBindings. The controller watches Cluster resources and manages
PolicyBindings in the relevant cluster namespaces on Seed clusters.
It also watches for PolicyTemplate resources as well and reconciles
the affected Clusters, in case the PolicyTemplate is updated.
